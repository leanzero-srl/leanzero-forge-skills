# Atlassian Confluence Forge Development

Build apps that extend Confluence Cloud on Atlassian's serverless Forge platform.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- The work targets **Confluence Cloud** specifically (not Jira — see `atlassian-jira-forge-skill` for that).
- You're declaring Confluence Forge modules in `manifest.yml` (`confluence:pageBanner`, `confluence:contentAction`, `macro`, etc.), writing resolvers, building Custom UI / UI Kit panels, or registering content/space properties.
- You're calling `/wiki/api/v2/...` (preferred) or `/wiki/rest/api/...` (legacy) from a Forge function.

Skip this skill for:
- Jira-only work (use `atlassian-jira-forge-skill`).
- Atlassian organization / cross-product admin operations (use `atlassian-organizations-api-skill`).
- Atlassian Connect or Data Center.

## Pick a starting point

- **Scaffolding a new module**: copy a template from `templates/`.
- **Production patterns** (KVS prefix indexing, ADF surgery, content-property version handling, capability-token web triggers, dual-strategy API fallback, in-isolate cache, dual `index.ts`): `docs/24-production-patterns.md`.
- **Macros that survive edits / content protection** (bodied macros, stable `sectionId`, attachment reversion): `docs/14-macros-and-section-sealing.md` + `docs/16-unified-content-triggers.md`.
- **AI inside the app** (`@forge/llm`, Claude, JSON-mode, async offload): `docs/15-forge-llm-integration.md`.
- **Relational store** (`@forge/sql`, migrations, limits, upserts): `docs/17-forge-sql.md`.
- **Reach unlicensed users / signed email links**: `docs/18-unlicensed-access-and-web-triggers.md`.
- **Limits & quotas** (timeouts, KVS quotas, queue limits, ADF size, consumer budget): `docs/27-faas-limits-and-cost.md`.
- **Points-based API rate limits** (65k/hr shared Tier-1 pool, 2 pts/identity object, tripwires/budget/quiet-window survival patterns, **what actually counts — `@forge/bridge` UI reads are exempt**, the `/spaces/{id}/permissions` 501-pts-per-page trap, and how to measure truthfully): `docs/31-points-rate-limiting.md`.
- **ADF vs storage format**: `docs/28-adf-and-storage-format.md`.

## Quick Reference

| Task | Module |
|---|---|
| Banner on every page / blogpost | `confluence:pageBanner` |
| Menu item in "more actions" (•••) | `confluence:contentAction` |
| Right-click context menu on selected text | `confluence:contextMenu` |
| Content byline area widget (under page title) | `confluence:contentBylineItem` |
| Editor macro (insert dynamic content) | `macro` |
| Custom content type indexed by Confluence | `confluence:customContent` |
| Right-rail item on the home feed | `confluence:homepageFeed` |
| Top-level admin settings page | `globalSettings` |
| Page in space navigation | `spacePage` |
| Page in the global "Apps" menu | `globalPage` |
| Per-content app data (CQL-indexed) | `confluence:contentProperty` |
| Cron-style background job | `scheduledTrigger` |
| Long-running work (>25s) | `trigger` → `consumer` (`@forge/events`, `timeoutSeconds:` up to 900) |
| Public HTTPS endpoint into the app | `webtrigger` (sign tokens — `18-...`) |
| Bodied macro that wraps/seals page content | `macro` (`layout: bodied`) — `14-...` |
| Claude inside the app, no egress | `llm` (`@forge/llm`) — `15-...` |
| Relational store (audit, aggregation) | `sql` (`@forge/sql`) — `17-...` |
| Surface reachable by unlicensed/guest users | `unlicensedAccess:` on `globalPage`/`pageBanner` — `18-...` |

> There is no `confluence:pageCustomUi` or `confluence:blogPostCustomUi` module. Use `confluence:pageBanner` for "render on every page" and `confluence:contentAction` for "menu item that opens a modal."

## Core API

```javascript
// Custom UI (frontend, runs in iframe)
import { requestConfluence, view, invoke } from '@forge/bridge';

const ctx  = await view.getContext();
const r    = await requestConfluence(`/wiki/api/v2/pages/${ctx.extension.content.id}?body-format=atlas_doc_format`);
const page = await r.json();

// Resolver / trigger / scheduled function (backend)
import api, { route } from '@forge/api';
import { kvs }        from '@forge/kvs';                  // named import; legacy `storage` from '@forge/api' is no longer receiving features after 2025-03-17
import Resolver       from '@forge/resolver';
import { Queue, InvocationError, InvocationErrorCode } from '@forge/events';

const r2 = await api.asUser().requestConfluence(route`/wiki/api/v2/pages/${pageId}`);
await kvs.set('config', { theme: 'dark' });
```

## Authentication — what's correct, what's wrong

| Pattern | Use? |
|---|---|
| `await requestConfluence('/wiki/api/v2/...')` from `@forge/bridge` (Custom UI) | **Yes** — Forge proxies the request and adds OAuth automatically. |
| `await api.asUser().requestConfluence(route\`...\`)` / `api.asApp()` (resolver) | **Yes** — token exchange handled for you. |
| `invoke('myResolver', payload)` from `@forge/bridge` | **Yes** — when the UI needs backend logic before/after the REST call. |
| `const token = await AP.context.getToken();` + `Authorization: 'JWT <token>'` | **No.** This is the legacy Atlassian Connect pattern — Forge apps do not use it. |
| Local `jsonwebtoken.sign(...)` against the Connect shared secret | **No.** Connect-only. |

If older docs in this skill use `AP.context.getToken()`, treat them as legacy reference. The replacement is always one of the patterns above.

## Manifest skeleton

```yaml
modules:
  confluence:pageBanner:
    - key: my-banner
      resource: main
      title: My Banner
  function:
    - key: handler
      handler: index.handler

resources:
  - key: main
    path: static/banner/build         # Custom UI build directory

permissions:
  scopes:
    - read:confluence-content.summary
    - storage:app
  external:
    fetch:
      backend:
        - api.atlassian.com           # only if you call the Org Admin API

app:
  id: ari:cloud:ecosystem::app/YOUR-APP-ID
  runtime:
    name: nodejs22.x                  # also valid: nodejs24.x, nodejs20.x
    memoryMB: 512                     # optional; raises CPU too
```

## Key Differences from the Jira Forge Skill

| Feature | Jira | Confluence |
|---|---|---|
| Workflow modules | Validators, conditions, post-functions | n/a |
| Issue-context UIs | `jira:issuePanel`, `jira:issueAction` | `confluence:contentBylineItem`, `confluence:contentAction` |
| Per-resource storage | Issue properties | Content / space properties (CQL-indexed) |
| Page body format | n/a | ADF (`atlas_doc_format`) or storage (XHTML) — see `28-adf-and-storage-format.md` |
| Events | Workflow transitions, issue lifecycle | `avi:confluence:created/updated/...:page|blogpost|comment|attachment|...` |

## Failure strategies

| Symptom | First-pass fix | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `403` permission denied | Add scope, run `forge install --upgrade` | `12-permissions-scopes.md` |
| `409 Conflict` on PUT page or property | You sent a stale `version.number` — GET → bump → PUT | `28-adf-and-storage-format.md` |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | Honor `Retry-After`, exponential backoff with jitter | `24-production-patterns.md` (Pattern 3) |
| Function timed out (~25s) | Push the work to an async queue | `26-async-events-and-queues.md` |
| "Refused to load script" / CSP errors | Allowlist host in `permissions.external.fetch.client` (or `.backend`); bundle scripts | `gotchas.md` |
| Tunnel doesn't apply manifest changes | Restart tunnel; `forge install --upgrade` if scopes changed | `gotchas.md` |
| Storage behaves impossibly (one function cannot read another's write; every prefix query is empty; `batchGet` missing) | **Check `node_modules/@forge/*/package.json` for `"version": "0.0.0"` BEFORE believing a platform story**, then `npm ci` | `gotchas.md` → Toolchain |
| `Cannot access 'x' before initialization` in a deployed function | A `const` read above its declaration; only runtime sees it. Turn on `no-use-before-define` | `gotchas.md` → Toolchain |
| Trigger fires on your own writes | Check `event.atlassianId` against your app's cached accountId (`filter.ignoreSelf` is **Jira-only** — not supported for Confluence product events) | `24-production-patterns.md` (Pattern 5) |

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `preflight-check.sh` | Verify CLI install, auth, manifest, lint |
| `validate-manifest.sh` | Run `forge lint` with parsed summary |
| `deploy-and-install.sh` | `forge deploy` + `forge install --upgrade` |
| `dev-setup.sh` | Start `forge tunnel` (`-e` for environment) |

Recommended workflow: `preflight-check.sh` → make changes → `validate-manifest.sh` → `deploy-and-install.sh`.

## Changelog

- **2026-08-26** — `gotchas.md` gains a **Toolchain** section carried over from
  the ChatWise incident, because it is platform-wide rather than Jira-specific:
  a stubbed `node_modules/@forge/*` deploys silently and looks exactly like an
  Atlassian outage (lint, webpack, `forge lint` and the unit suite all pass —
  the unit tests stub those packages themselves); `no-use-before-define` as a
  runtime rather than style rule; and the KVS 240 KiB value limit being **bytes,
  not characters**, which turns character-based chunking into a bug that waits
  for the first non-ASCII document. Pre-deploy check:
  `atlassian-jira-forge-skill/templates/check-forge-deps.mjs`.

- **2026-08-26** — `31-points-rate-limiting.md` substantially extended after Atlassian returned server-side telemetry for License Leash (~1.11M pts/day against a self-reported 250-280k — a 4x under-count in the APP'S OWN METER, not a hidden consumer). New: **only app-initiated BACKEND traffic counts** — `@forge/bridge` UI reads with no resolver are exempt (staff post #133), the cheapest optimisation available and absent from the docs; **no official per-endpoint cost catalog exists** and the rule is measurably NOT applied consistently, so derived costs are upper bounds not plans; the **`/spaces/<built-in function id>/permissions` trap** (permissions ARE identity objects — 2 pts per permission ROW, ~501/page at limit=250, partner-measured and staff-acknowledged-then-dropped, plus live confirmation from a 429 on page 94); **POST-that-reads ambiguity** (users-bulk 1 vs 501); **measuring truthfully** (the `X-RateLimit-Remaining` delta is ground truth; `FORGE_API_REQUEST_COUNT` counts requests and cannot carry the object multiplier; Forge exposes no trace id); the **self-meter defect classes** (only 2 of 3 model terms implemented, one call site passing `objects:` instead of `identityObjects:`, tallies never flushed from resolvers) and the rule that a meter feeding a budgeter is NOT capture-only; and **pool scope** — every doc says per-app-across-all-tenants, while "per Forge environment" is undocumented and contradicted in public. Also corrected this file's own now-false "~12-point quiet hours" claim.
- **2026-08-20** — `31-points-rate-limiting.md` gains three patterns and two gotchas from the License Leash 4.87.0 incident day: **credit your own writes** (an app that watches group counts AND writes memberships reads its own writes as external change — ledger genuine changes only at the lowest HTTP write layer; Confluence 409-on-duplicate-add / 404-on-absent-delete are the no-op signals; a credited no-op is the one shape that can mask real change), **failed-pass retries are schedule, not evidence** (defer non-load-bearing repair retries to the quiet window with 48h degradation and a run-now bypass), **grace windows are not ground truth** (a 24h stale-verdict auth fallback still locked out an admin returning after a longer gap — durable mirrored state beats recent-success TTLs); plus Forge SQL's own installation rate limits being hit by product-event write storms, and same-wall-clock-hour pool exhaustion across days as the fingerprint of a foreign tenant's scheduled job in the shared pool.
- **2026-08-12** — Added `31-points-rate-limiting.md`: the points quota model verified against live enforcement (1 pt/request + 2 pts/identity object; Tier 1 = 65k/hr shared across ALL installs; Tier 2 per-tenant post-review; `RateLimit-Reason`/`Beta-RateLimit-Policy` headers — observed live value `conf-global-based` differs from the doc's), plus the survival architecture proven on License Leash 4.75→4.86 (scheduling-layer containment, count tripwires with the raw-representation rule, quiet-window re-baselines with episode-stamp bounds, soft budget with admission clamp, capture-only telemetry incl. previously-invisible auth walks, org-pool relief valve) and the platform gotchas met on the way (forge logs -n cap, warm-container module scope, auth-before-migrations schema tolerance, cross-hop queue fields, build-stamp verification).

- **2026-06-26** — Folded battle-tested learnings from **Sentinel Vault** (content protection / Forge LLM) and **License Leash** (cross-product license manager). Added docs `14-macros-and-section-sealing.md`, `15-forge-llm-integration.md`, `16-unified-content-triggers.md`, `17-forge-sql.md`, `18-unlicensed-access-and-web-triggers.md`. Enhanced `24-production-patterns.md` (4 new patterns: in-isolate cache, debounced writes, dual `index.ts`, Custom UI assets/dialogs/theme), `27-faas-limits-and-cost.md` (consumer budget + cursor-resume, siloed cross-product storage, Forge SQL limits), `28-adf-and-storage-format.md` (canonical ADF hashing), `30-testing-and-tunneling.md` (multi-layer harness), and `gotchas.md` (`asUser()` in background jobs, event field parsing, group-API quirks, HTTPS egress ports). New templates: `bodied-macro-section-seal.yml`, `forge-sql-migration.js`, `unlicensed-access-page.yml`, `hmac-web-trigger.js`. Forge-LLM model ids per the `claude-api` skill; `@forge/sql` limits per the official docs. Cross-skill see-also: Forge LLM (`atlassian-jira-forge-skill` + `claude-api`), license-via-group-membership (`atlassian-organizations-api-skill` + `confluence-api-skill`).
- Replaced the legacy "Authentication via OAuth 2.0 (3LO) or JWT from Forge" claim with the three actually-valid patterns; added an explicit "Auth note" preamble to every doc/template that still contained `AP.context.getToken()` (Atlassian Connect, not Forge).
- Standardized on the named KVS import: `import { kvs } from '@forge/kvs'`. Legacy `storage` from `@forge/api` flagged with the 2025-03-17 deprecation date.
- Removed the spurious `forge register` step from `templates/page-custom-ui.yml` (no such command — use `forge install --upgrade`).
- Renumbered duplicate prefixes: `07-permissions-scopes.md` → `12-`, `08-cli-commands.md` → `13-`.
- Added five new docs: `24-production-patterns.md` (15 patterns from Sentinel Vault and License Leash), `26-async-events-and-queues.md`, `27-faas-limits-and-cost.md`, `28-adf-and-storage-format.md`, `30-testing-and-tunneling.md`. Removed `24-real-world-patterns.md` (folded in).
- Stripped emoji from shell scripts; added `set -euo pipefail` headers.
