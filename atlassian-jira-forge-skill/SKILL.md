# Atlassian Jira Forge Development

Build apps that extend Jira Cloud on Atlassian's serverless Forge platform.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- The work targets **Jira Cloud** specifically (not Confluence Cloud — see `atlassian-confluence-forge-skill` for that).
- You're declaring Forge modules in `manifest.yml`, writing resolvers/validators/post-functions, or building Custom UI / UI Kit panels.
- You need to call the Jira REST API from a Forge function via `@forge/api`.

Skip this skill for:
- Confluence-only work, JSM-only work that doesn't touch Jira issues, or non-Forge platforms (Connect, OAuth 2.0 3LO apps, Data Center).

## Pick a starting point

- **Scaffolding a new module**: copy a template from `templates/` (validator, condition, post-function, async-queue-consumer, custom-field-type, capability-token-webtrigger, workflow-config-view, etc.).
- **Production patterns** (sharding, backoff+jitter, drafts/locks, write-verify, two-engine parity, capability tokens, async offload, fail-open validators): `docs/24-production-patterns.md`.
- **Workflow rules in depth** (create/edit/view split, conditions are expressions never functions, per-instance ids, agentic validation, semantic-PF editmeta pre-flight): `docs/25-workflow-modules-deep-dive.md`.
- **AI / LLM in a Forge app** (`@forge/llm` hosted, BYOK multi-provider, three-layer cost guard): `docs/31-forge-ai-and-llm.md`.
- **Live multi-user UI** (`@forge/realtime`): `docs/32-forge-realtime.md`.
- **Limits & quotas** (timeouts, KVS quotas, queue limits): `docs/27-faas-limits-and-cost.md`.
- **Decision: which module type?** `docs/when-to-use-which.md`.

## Quick Reference

| Task | Module |
|---|---|
| Validate fields before transition | `jira:workflowValidator` |
| Hide/show transitions | `jira:workflowCondition` |
| Run logic after transition | `jira:workflowPostFunction` |
| Cron-style background job | `scheduledTrigger` |
| Long-running work (>25s) | `trigger` → `consumer` (async event with `timeoutSeconds:` up to 900) |
| Public HTTPS endpoint into the app | `webtrigger` |
| Custom field (view + edit) | `jira:customField` / `jira:customFieldType` |
| Issue-context UI | `jira:issuePanel` / `jira:issueAction` |
| Full-page UI | `jira:globalPage` / `jira:adminPage` / `jira:projectPage` |
| Dashboard widget | `jira:dashboardGadget` |
| Bitbucket merge gate | `bitbucket:mergeCheck` |

## Core API

```javascript
import api, { route } from '@forge/api';
import { kvs } from '@forge/kvs';
import Resolver from '@forge/resolver';
import { Queue, InvocationError, InvocationErrorCode } from '@forge/events';

// REST call (always use route`...` to auto-encode interpolations)
const r = await api.asApp().requestJira(route`/rest/api/3/issue/${key}`);

// KVS (named import — required scope: storage:app)
await kvs.set('config', { theme: 'dark' });
const config = await kvs.get('config');

// Resolver (Custom UI / UI Kit backend)
const resolver = new Resolver();
resolver.define('getText', async ({ payload, context }) => 'Hello');
export const handler = resolver.getDefinitions();

// Async queue offload (>25s work)
const queue = new Queue({ key: 'long-jobs' });
await queue.push({ body: { taskId: '...' } });
```

## Manifest skeleton

```yaml
modules:
  jira:workflowValidator:
    - key: my-validator
      name: My Validator
      description: Validates fields before transition
      function: validate
  function:
    - key: validate
      handler: index.validate

permissions:
  scopes:
    - read:jira-work
    - write:jira-work
    - storage:app
  external:
    fetch:
      backend:
        - api.openai.com

app:
  id: ari:cloud:ecosystem::app/YOUR-APP-ID
  runtime:
    name: nodejs22.x   # also valid: nodejs24.x, nodejs20.x
    memoryMB: 512      # optional; raises CPU too
```

## Failure strategies (one-liners; details in linked docs)

| Symptom | First-pass fix | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `403` permission denied | Add scope to `permissions.scopes`, run `forge install --upgrade` | `07-permissions-scopes.md` |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | Honor `Retry-After`, add exponential backoff with jitter | `19-rate-limit-handling.md` + `24-production-patterns.md` |
| Function timed out (~25s) | Push the work to an async queue (`@forge/events`), set `timeoutSeconds: 900` | `26-async-events-and-queues.md` |
| "Refused to load script" / CSP errors | Allowlist host in `permissions.external.fetch.client` (or `.backend`); bundle scripts | `gotchas.md`, `23-custom-ui-advanced.md` |
| Tunnel doesn't apply manifest changes | Restart tunnel; `forge install --upgrade` if scopes changed | `gotchas.md` |
| KVS hot key (>1 MB/s writes) | Shard: `key:{i}` with deterministic mapping | `24-production-patterns.md` |
| Storage behaves impossibly (one function cannot read another's write; every prefix query is empty; `batchGet` missing) | **Check `node_modules/@forge/*/package.json` for `"version": "0.0.0"` BEFORE believing a platform story**, then `npm ci` | `gotchas.md` → Toolchain |
| `Cannot access 'x' before initialization` in a deployed function | A `const` read above its declaration; nothing but runtime sees it. Turn on `no-use-before-define` | `gotchas.md` → Toolchain |
| Bulk create attributes keys to the wrong issues | `body.issues` holds only the SUCCESSES; read `body.errors[].failedElementNumber` first | `gotchas.md` → Jira REST |
| A big structured model reply is cut mid-array | Output length is the ceiling, not context — one call per group, not one huge call | `31-forge-ai-and-llm.md` |

## Scripts

CI-safe shell scripts in `scripts/`:

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `preflight-check.sh` | Verify CLI install, auth, manifest, lint |
| `check-forge-deps.mjs` (template) | **Run first in every deploy script.** Fails the deploy if an `@forge/*` package does not match the lock file or looks stubbed |
| `validate-manifest.sh` | Run `forge lint` with parsed summary |
| `deploy-and-install.sh` | `forge deploy` + `forge install --upgrade` |
| `dev-setup.sh` | Start `forge tunnel` (`-e` for environment) |

Recommended workflow: `preflight-check.sh` → make changes → `validate-manifest.sh` → `deploy-and-install.sh`.

## Changelog

- **2026-10-03** — Corrected the claim that a `jira:workflowCondition` runs a Forge function (that `expression: "true"` was "REQUIRED" so Jira would invoke it on every issue view, that `validate` served conditions, a 25 s condition timeout). False per the Forge manifest schema (`@forge/manifest` 12.9.0): the condition module has a REQUIRED `expression` and NO `function` property; Jira evaluates the expression itself, so a condition cannot call REST, KVS or a model. Rewritten: `03-workflow-conditions.md` (also in `jira-api-skill`), `25` ("Conditions are Jira expressions, never functions"), `01`, `27`, `07`, `gotchas.md`, `when-to-use-which.md`, templates `condition.yml` and `workflow-config-view.yml`. The `25`/`01`/`27`/`gotchas` wording matches CogniRunner's F-2616 scrub of these passages word for word, so its knowledge bake is unchanged.
- **2026-08-26** — `19-rate-limit-handling.md` gains the verified 2026 points findings: **only app-initiated backend traffic counts** (`@forge/bridge` UI reads with no resolver are exempt — staff post #133 — the highest-leverage fix for a points-constrained app, with its caveats); **Jira's identity class adds Project Roles** on top of Users/Groups/Permissions, so role and permission-scheme walks are identity-priced; the only published multi-object worked example (1 + 8 users = 17) and the fact that everything else is derived; **the rule is measurably not applied consistently** (partner-measured endpoints charging flat 1 point at ~500-1000 objects); **POST-that-reads is charged per object** (`search/jql` measured at ~11.4 pts/call, not 1); measuring against the `X-RateLimit-Remaining` delta rather than a model, and why `FORGE_API_REQUEST_COUNT` cannot substitute; the self-meter defect classes that produced a 4x under-count on a live estate; and that "per Forge environment" pool scope is undocumented.
- **2026-08-26** — Folded in a day of production learnings from **ChatWise**
  (document → whole Jira backlog). `gotchas.md` gains a **Toolchain** section
  led by the one that cost two hours: a stubbed `node_modules/@forge/*` deploys
  silently and looks exactly like a platform outage, because lint, webpack,
  `forge lint` and the unit suite all pass — the unit tests stub those packages
  themselves. Plus `no-use-before-define` as a runtime, not style, rule; the KVS
  240 KiB limit being **bytes not characters** (chunk by chars and the first
  German document breaks the write); and `POST /issue/bulk` returning **only the
  successes** in `body.issues`, which makes positional mapping wrong and, on a
  hierarchy, silently re-parents everything after a rejected element.
  `31-forge-ai-and-llm.md` gains structured-generation practice: output length
  (not context) is the real ceiling so split one call per group; a deadline
  inside the 900 s consumer/poller ceiling with an honest partial; progress into
  the job row; and why a plan approval must be a stricter predicate than a
  destructive confirmation. `24-production-patterns.md` gains pattern 21,
  materialising a generated hierarchy into Jira resumably. New template
  `check-forge-deps.mjs`.
- **2026-08-20** — `19-rate-limit-handling.md` gains the transferable quota-survival patterns from the License Leash incident day: credit-your-own-writes (apps that watch and write the same population read their own writes as external change; ledger genuine changes only — 409/404 no-ops excluded), failed-pass retries deferred to a quiet window with bounded degradation, grace-TTL auth fallbacks vs durable mirrored state, and Forge SQL's own installation rate limits being hit by per-event write storms.
- **2026-06-26** — Folded in production learnings from **lz-ppm-forge**, **se-ppm-forge**, and **CogniRunner**. New docs `25-workflow-modules-deep-dive.md` (create/edit/view split, `expression:"true"`, per-instance rule ids, agentic validation, semantic-PF editmeta pre-flight), `31-forge-ai-and-llm.md` (`@forge/llm` hosted + BYOK multi-provider adapter + three-layer cost guard), `32-forge-realtime.md`. Enhanced `24` (patterns 13–20: stale-draft invalidation, write-verify, two-engine parity, layered config, KVS cost control, issue-link semantics, custom-field screen chain, field-screen preflight), `26` (consumer error handling + `FAIL_IF_EXISTS` idempotency), `06` (cursor-paged `search/jql`, bulkfetch, agile rank, write flags), `28` (HTTPS + port allowlist, correcting the "443 only" myth), `27` (hot-key batching, Forge LLM = Preview), `30` (offline harnesses + parity), `gotchas` (KVS TOCTOU, `expression:"true"`, registry staleness). New templates `workflow-config-view.yml`, `byok-provider-adapter.js`, `forge-llm-cost-guard.js`, `realtime-publisher.js`.
- Merged `06-api-endpoints.md` and the prior `-enhanced.md` variant into one canonical reference, with the per-resource `docs/api/` folder linked as an appendix.
- Renumbered duplicate prefixes: `02-ui-modifications.md` → `14-`, `18-custom-ui-advanced.md` → `23-`.
- Removed the long-stale claim that workflow validators/conditions/post-functions are Connect-only — they are real, supported Forge modules.
- Standardized on the named KVS import: `import { kvs } from '@forge/kvs'`.
- Added five new docs: `26-async-events-and-queues.md`, `27-faas-limits-and-cost.md`, `28-forge-remote-and-egress.md`, `29-custom-field-types.md`, `30-testing-and-tunneling.md`.
- Added three new templates: `async-queue-consumer.yml`, `custom-field-type.yml`, `capability-token-webtrigger.yml`.
- Stripped emoji from shell scripts; added `set -euo pipefail` headers.
