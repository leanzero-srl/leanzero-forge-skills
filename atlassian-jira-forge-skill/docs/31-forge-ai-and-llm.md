# Forge AI & LLM Integration

Two ways to add an LLM to a Forge app, and the cost/safety scaffolding both need:

1. **Forge-hosted LLMs** (`@forge/llm`) — Claude served inside Atlassian, no key, no egress, keeps the **"Runs on Atlassian"** badge.
2. **BYOK** — your code calls OpenAI / Anthropic / Azure / OpenRouter / AWS Bedrock / self-hosted, which needs an egress declaration and the user's own key.

Grounded in **lz-ppm-forge** (`src/resolvers/ai-resolvers.js` — cost guards), **CogniRunner** (`src/async-handler.js` — BYOK adapter, `manifest.yml` — `llm` module), and the `claude-api` skill (model ids).

## `@forge/llm` — the hosted path

> **Preview** as of 2026-06. Can be enabled in production. Supports **Claude Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus** at the platform level. No external egress, so the app keeps the **"Runs on Atlassian"** badge.

```yaml
# manifest.yml — adding this module is a MAJOR version bump + admin re-consent
modules:
  llm:
    - key: cogni-llm
      model:
        - claude          # family name; Atlassian maps it to a Forge-hosted Claude model
```

```javascript
import { chat, list } from '@forge/llm';

// chat() is OpenAI-chat-completions-shaped. There is no response_format in Preview —
// enforce JSON via a system message and parse tolerantly.
const sys = jsonMode
  ? systemPrompt + '\n\nRespond with ONLY a valid JSON object. No markdown fences, no prose.'
  : systemPrompt;
const res = await chat({
  model: 'claude',                       // or a snapshot id; the family name is safest
  messages: [
    ...(sys ? [{ role: 'system', content: sys }] : []),
    { role: 'user', content: userMessage },
  ],
  max_completion_tokens: MAX_OUTPUT,     // size per model AND per gateway time (~8k on Forge LLM:
                                         // longer replies can hit a ~180 s gateway 504); never a bare 4096
});
// A reply cut for length (finish_reason "length") is NOT complete: never parse, save or execute it.
if (res?.choices?.[0]?.finish_reason === 'length') throw new Error('reply cut off - ask for less or write in parts');
let content = res?.choices?.[0]?.message?.content;
if (Array.isArray(content))              // some responses come back as content parts
  content = content.filter((p) => p?.type === 'text').map((p) => p.text || '').join('');
const tokens = res?.usage?.total_tokens
  || (res?.usage?.input_tokens || 0) + (res?.usage?.output_tokens || 0);
```

Notes from production (CogniRunner `async-handler.js` `callAIChatSimple`, `atlassian` branch):
- **Adding the `llm` module is a major version upgrade** — existing installs must approve the update. Observed consistently across CogniRunner, lz-ppm, and Sentinel Vault; treat it as expected behaviour.
- **All token usage is billed to the app vendor's Forge bill** — there is no free quota. Cost-guard it (below).
- Errors surface as `ForgeLlmAPIError` with top-level `.status` / `.message` (no `.context`).
- Apps that restrict to Haiku (lz-ppm, Sentinel Vault) do so as a **cost choice**, not a platform limit.

### Model ids (use these verbatim — from the `claude-api` skill)

| Family | Bare alias | Snapshot | Context | Price (in/out per MTok) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | `claude-haiku-4-5` | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | 200K | $1 / $5 |
| Claude Sonnet 4.6 | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | — | 200K | — |
| Claude Opus 4.8 | `claude-opus-4-8` | — | 200K | — |

In a `llm` manifest module the value is the **family name** `claude`. Never invent a dated suffix for a bare alias — `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` is the one real dated Haiku id. See the `claude-api` skill for the current pricing/limits.

## Three-layer cost guard (advisory AI)

lz-ppm's optional AI plan review is **OFF by default** and **advisory-only** (never mutates the schedule). Every paid call goes through three guards, enforced *before any spend* (`src/resolvers/ai-resolvers.js`):

**Layer 1 — admin kill-switch + caps.** Config in KVS (`cfg:ai`), default `enabled:false`, plus soft monthly/daily review caps:

```javascript
const cfg = await getCfg();              // { enabled:false, monthlyCap:500, dailyCap:100 }
if (!cfg.enabled) return { enabled: false };
// ... cap check BEFORE the LLM call:
if (cfg.monthlyCap > 0 && monthMeter.reviews >= cfg.monthlyCap)
  return { enabled: true, capReached: true, scope: 'month' };
```

**Layer 2 — result cache, TTL-bounded, keyed by content hash + plan + account.** An unchanged re-review is a free hit (no LLM, no meter):

```javascript
const cacheKey = `cfg:ai:cache:${planId}:${accountId}:${hashSummary(summary)}`;
// hashSummary = pure-JS FNV-1a of JSON.stringify(summary) + length (no crypto import)
const cached = await kvs.get(cacheKey);
if (cached?.result && Date.now() - cached.at < CACHE_TTL_MS) // 10 min
  return { enabled: true, cached: true, ...cached.result };
```

**Cache ONLY complete, clean results** — never an error or a truncated answer, or a cut-off review freezes and gets re-served as authoritative:

```javascript
if (!result.error && !result.parseError && !result.incomplete)
  await kvs.set(cacheKey, { result, at: Date.now() });
```

**Layer 3 — token metering, best-effort.** Count only **billable round-trips** (`usage` present == the LLM was called and charged, even on a parse failure). Cached / cap / empty paths never reach the meter. A meter write must **never fail the review**:

```javascript
if (result.usage) {
  try {
    monthMeter.reviews += 1;
    monthMeter.inputTokens  += result.usage.input_tokens  || 0;
    monthMeter.outputTokens += result.usage.output_tokens || 0;
    await kvs.set(monthKey, monthMeter);
  } catch { /* meter is best-effort; never fail the review on a meter write */ }
}
```

Usage is exposed read-only to the admin UI (`getAiConfig` returns `monthlyRemaining` / `dailyRemaining`). See `templates/forge-llm-cost-guard.js` for the full guarded wrapper.

## BYOK multi-provider adapter

CogniRunner ships a unified, OpenAI-shaped `callAIChat` that translates per provider. Provider selection and keys live in KVS:

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `COGNIRUNNER_AI_PROVIDER` | active provider (`atlassian` is the keyless default) |
| `COGNIRUNNER_KEY_<provider>` | per-provider API key (use `setSecret`) |
| `COGNIRUNNER_MODEL_<provider>` | per-provider model id |
| `COGNIRUNNER_AI_BASE_URL` | user base URL (Azure / LM Studio / custom) |

Per-provider slots mean switching provider **doesn't delete** the other's key — switching back is instant. A legacy single-key slot is migrated on read.

### Per-provider request translation

All providers normalise to `{ ok, content, tokens }`. The differences that matter (CogniRunner `async-handler.js:223-378`):

| Provider | Endpoint / call | Auth header | Body shape notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Forge LLM** (`atlassian`) | `@forge/llm` `chat()` | none | OpenAI-shaped; JSON via system msg; keyless |
| **OpenAI** | `POST {base}/chat/completions` | `Authorization: Bearer` | `response_format` JSON works |
| **Azure** | `POST {base}/chat/completions` | `api-key` | deployment-name as model; user base URL |
| **OpenRouter** | `POST {base}/chat/completions` | `Authorization: Bearer` | add `HTTP-Referer` + `X-Title`; skip `response_format` (many upstream models reject it) |
| **Anthropic** | `POST {base}/v1/messages` | `x-api-key` + `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01` | top-level `system`; **`max_tokens` REQUIRED**; reply in `content[].text` |
| **AWS Bedrock** | `POST {base}/model/{model}/converse` | `Authorization: Bearer` | Converse API; `inferenceConfig.maxTokens`; region-derived URL; **don't `encodeURIComponent` the model id** (ids contain `:`, e.g. `…-v1:0`); cross-region inference-profile ids (e.g. `eu.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6`) |
| **LM Studio** | `POST {base}/api/v1/chat` (native) | optional `Bearer` | self-hosted tunnel; `reasoning:"off"` (learn + persist models that 400 on it); never use `reasoning_content` as the answer (it is draft thinking; when `content` is empty treat the reply as failed) |

Anthropic, condensed:

```javascript
const r = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/v1/messages`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'x-api-key': apiKey, 'anthropic-version': '2023-06-01' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ model, max_tokens: MAX_OUTPUT, system: systemPrompt, // REQUIRED: the model's own cap, not 4096
                         messages: [{ role: 'user', content: userMessage }] }),
});
const data = await r.json();
const text = (data.content || []).filter((b) => b.type === 'text').map((b) => b.text).join('');
```

Bedrock model fallback id observed in production: `eu.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6` (an EU cross-region inference profile; admins pick the actual model). See `templates/byok-provider-adapter.js` for the full adapter and `28-forge-remote-and-egress.md` for the egress declarations each provider needs.

## Hosted vs BYOK — how to choose

| | Forge-hosted (`@forge/llm`) | BYOK |
|---|---|---|
| Egress declaration | none | required (`permissions.external.fetch.*`) |
| "Runs on Atlassian" badge | **kept** | lost |
| Models | Claude (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus) | any provider/model |
| Billing | app vendor's Forge bill | user's own key |
| Setup for the user | zero (keyless) | paste a key |
| Manifest cost | major bump + re-consent to add the module | major bump + re-consent on egress category change |

CogniRunner makes Forge-hosted the **no-key factory default** and lets power users switch to BYOK for a specific model/provider.

## Async-PF idempotency for AI work

Forge async events are **at-least-once** — a successful invocation can be redelivered. Claim the execution atomically *before* doing side-effectful AI work, so a redelivery skips instead of double-posting:

```javascript
// CogniRunner async-handler.js — executeQueuedPostFunction
await kvs.set(`pf_exec:${taskId}`, { issueKey, claimedAt: new Date().toISOString() }, {
  keyPolicy: 'FAIL_IF_EXISTS',                 // atomic conditional write
  ttl: { value: 6, unit: 'HOURS' },
});
// on KEY_ALREADY_EXISTS (or 409 / "already exists") → return { deduped: true }
```

Claim-**first** means a crash mid-execution is *not* retried with side effects intact — for fail-open automations, duplicates are the worse failure. See `26-async-events-and-queues.md` for the queue mechanics and `30-testing-and-tunneling.md` for the per-provider barrage test.

## `@forge/llm` facts you cannot infer (measured, 2026)

### It is TEXT-ONLY
`type ContentPart = TextPart` in **both** 0.6.7 and 1.0.4. There is no image
part, so a picture can never reach the model as a picture — this single fact
determines every "can it read screenshots" answer. If you need image content,
something else has to turn it into text; doing that **in the browser** avoids
the 500 KB invoke limit entirely (see `23-custom-ui-advanced.md`).

### Output ceiling is NOT 32k — it is the model's own
Probed against the gateway: every served model accepts
`max_completion_tokens` up to **128,000**. A lower cap in your code is
self-imposed. Verify per tier rather than assuming; it is one call.

### `list()` returns `{model, status}` and nothing else
No context window, no output limit, no pricing. Budgeting is entirely app-side,
so you need your own table — and it must be refreshed by probing, not by recall.
A stale model id fails as a **silent downgrade**, not an error.

### `finish_reason: "length"` is the ONLY truncation signal
Nothing surfaces it by default. Read `choices[].finish_reason` and propagate it,
or a reply cut mid-JSON is indistinguishable from a model that answered badly.

Real case: a wizard called `chat()` without `maxTokens`, so the client's own
4096 default applied; the JSON payload was cut mid-array, a tolerant parser
still accepted the fragment, and the user saw *"No ticket data in creation
payload"* — an error message about a completely different thing. The reported
symptom was "it fails past 7.5k context", which was the token chip in the UI
showing input+output. It was an OUTPUT cut all along.

### There is a per-tenant, per-model TOKEN QUOTA
```
429 Forge LLM token usage limit exceeded. This tenant (ari:cloud:jira:…) has
reached its limit of 50000 tokens for model anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-…
```
Undocumented as far as I can find, and it is **per model** — so a heavy test run
exhausts whichever tier your active personas point at while the others still
answer. Budget your live testing, and treat a 429 here as a quota problem rather
than a rate-limit blip.

**It is the usual cause of several UNRELATED specs failing in one long batch run
while each passes on its own.** Check for it before diagnosing N separate bugs:

```bash
npx forge logs --environment development --since 60m | grep "token usage limit"
```

A practical consequence: if your app pins personas or presets to a specific
model id, a superseded tier can quietly become the one without headroom while
the picker shows something newer. Migrate the stored ids, not just the offered
list.

### OUTPUT LENGTH is the ceiling for structured generation, not context

The instinct on a big job is to worry about the input window. With a 1M-token
context and a 128k output ceiling that is almost never what bites. What bites is
that **a single large JSON reply gets cut mid-array**, and a truncated object is
not a smaller answer — it is an unparseable one, and the error surfaces as
something about *content* for a failure that was purely about *length*.

Measured: a persona configured with `max_tokens: 16384` asked for a
hundred-issue plan in one object produced a fragment every time. The same work
split into **one call per parent** — group the material first, then one call per
group — produced 135 items with no truncation at all, because every individual
reply is a handful of children.

Splitting buys three things beyond not truncating:

1. **Resumability.** A run that dies after four of eight groups has four groups
   of real output, not nothing.
2. **A deadline you can honour.** Check the clock between calls and return a
   partial (see below) instead of dying at the invocation ceiling.
3. **Cheaper prompts.** Each call carries only its own group's material, not the
   whole corpus.

Cost for a 24 KB source document: 1 extraction call + 1 per group ≈ 8–13 calls,
about 6 minutes wall clock on Sonnet.

### A multi-call turn needs a deadline INSIDE the 900 s ceiling

The async consumer's `timeoutSeconds` maxes at 900, and the typical front-end
poller gives up at the same 900 s — so a run that uses all of it produces
**nothing the user can see**. Pass a `deadlineAt` into every stage and return
what you have:

```js
const deadlineAt = Date.now() + 12 * 60 * 1000;   // 12 min, inside 15
// ...between calls:
if (deadlineAt && Date.now() > deadlineAt) {
  return { ok: items.length > 0, items, partial: true, unread: remaining };
}
```

And **report the shortfall in the units the user cares about**. A stage that
stops early must say how much of the source it never opened; the first version
of ours reported "0 characters not read" for a document it had barely started,
because it counted only the truncation its own windowing had done and not the
windows the deadline meant it would never open. That is the one number in a
feature like this that must never flatter itself.

### Write progress to the job row; the poller is already reading it

A five-minute turn is an unexplained spinner otherwise. The status field a
polling client already renders is free real estate:

```js
onProgress: async (p) => {
  await writeJob(jobId, { progressNote: `${p.note} ${p.done}/${p.total}` });
}
// getJobStatus: prefer the note over the generic per-status line
status: (job.status === "processing" && job.progressNote) || STATUS_TEXT[job.status],
```

Remember the job-row `result` object is usually an **explicit allow-list**: a
field added upstream and not added there is silently dropped, and the symptom is
a feature that simply never appears.

### An approval that gates real writes must be STRICTER than a confirmation

Two different situations, and one predicate does not serve both:

- A **destructive-tool confirmation** follows a direct question the model just
  asked, so "does this message contain a yes" is a fair test.
- A **plan approval** arrives cold, with the plan on screen and the user free to
  say anything. There, an unanchored `/\byes\b/` reads *"yes I know, but can you
  show me epic 3 first?"* as permission to create sixty-three issues. Verified
  by running it.

Four conditions, each of which killed a real false positive: **no question
mark** (a question is never an approval, however many yeses); **no negation**,
except the ones that mean yes (`"approve, no changes"`); the affirmative in the
**first clause**, not buried after a *but*; and the message **asks for nothing
else** (`show`, `list`, `explain`, `first`, `wait`, `before`…).

And when a sentence says both stop and continue — *"forget it, I'll finish the
rest myself"* — **the one that stops wins**. Check the cancel pattern *before*
the continuation pattern, and make any belt-and-braces second gate use a
DIFFERENT predicate from the one that made the decision; a gate that re-asks the
same question can only ever agree.

### Tool calling is OpenAI-shaped
`{type: "function", function: {name, description, parameters}}`, and results go
back as `role: "tool"` messages carrying `tool_call_id`.

**Tool results are untrusted input.** If you carefully fence issue text and
uploaded documents in the system prompt but push tool results back as a bare
`JSON.stringify`, you have fenced nothing — the model reaches the same content
by calling a tool, and on a global-page surface that is the *only* path it
takes. Envelope them and state the rule once in the system prompt.
