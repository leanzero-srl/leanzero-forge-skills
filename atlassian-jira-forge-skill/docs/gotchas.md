# Forge Development Gotchas (Jira)

Environment-specific facts and pitfalls that defy reasonable assumptions. Read once before you start; revisit when something's mysteriously broken.

## Toolchain

### A stubbed `node_modules/@forge/*` deploys silently, and looks exactly like a platform outage

`forge deploy` bundles whatever is in `node_modules`. If anything has replaced
`@forge/kvs`, `@forge/llm` or `@forge/api` with a local test double — an agent
running app modules under plain node, a half-finished offline harness, a
`npm link` — **that double is what ships**, and every check you have will pass:

- `npm run lint` — fine, it is valid JavaScript.
- `npm run build` — fine, webpack bundles it happily.
- `npx forge lint` — fine, it reads the manifest, not the dependency tree.
- The unit suite — fine, and this is the trap: unit tests **stub these packages
  themselves** and never load the real ones, so a green suite is evidence about
  the stubs, not about the app.

**What it looks like in production** (all observed, 26 Aug 2026, on ChatWise):

| Symptom | Cause in the stub |
|---|---|
| A resolver writes a key; the async consumer reads it back as `undefined`, for minutes, while the resolver keeps returning it | the stub kvs is an in-memory `Map` and **every Forge function gets its own copy** |
| Every `kvs.query().where('key', beginsWith(...))` returns zero results for rows `kvs.set` definitely wrote | the stub's `query()` returns `{results: []}` unconditionally |
| `_forge_kvs.zH.batchGet is not a function` | the stub implements only `get`/`set`/`delete` |
| Every model call fails with a message you have never written | the stub's `chat()` throws |

Two hours went into diagnosing that as an Atlassian incident. The tell was in
`node_modules/@forge/kvs/package.json`: **`"version": "0.0.0"`**, where the lock
file said `1.6.5`.

**If the app behaves impossibly, check the dependency versions BEFORE you
believe a platform story**, then `npm ci`.

**The fix is a pre-deploy check**, because nothing else in the pipeline can see
it. `templates/check-forge-deps.mjs` in this skill: every critical `@forge/*`
package must match the version the lock file names and carry no stub marker in
its entry point. Wire it as the first line of your deploy script.

```bash
echo "🔒 Checking dependency integrity..."
node scripts/check-forge-deps.mjs   # exits 1 and deploys nothing if a package was replaced
```

### `no-use-before-define` is not a style rule in a Forge function

A `const` read above its own declaration is a **`ReferenceError` at runtime and
nowhere else** — the TDZ is invisible to lint defaults, to webpack, and to
`forge lint`. In an async consumer it kills every invocation of that function
with a message (`Cannot access 'x' before initialization`) that names a variable
and not a cause.

It shipped once because a tool list came to depend on a flag declared eighteen
lines further down. Turn the rule on and it becomes a build failure:

```js
// .eslintrc.js — functions stay hoistable, which most codebases rely on
"no-use-before-define": ["error", { functions: false, classes: false, variables: true }],
```

Enabling it found two more latent cases in the same repo the same minute.

## Development Environment

### `forge tunnel` doesn't pick up manifest changes
Adding a scope, module, or external-fetch entry to `manifest.yml` while the tunnel is running will *not* apply.
- Stop the tunnel (`Ctrl+C`).
- Run `forge deploy` (or `forge install --upgrade` if scopes changed — users must approve new scopes).
- Restart `forge tunnel`.

### `api.asApp()` vs `api.asUser()`
- `asApp()` runs with the app's own permissions — use for background tasks, scheduled triggers, post-functions, async consumers.
- `asUser()` runs with the invoking user's permissions — use for UI interactions where row-level visibility matters.
- Mixing them up leaks data: `asApp()` in a UI handler can show users data they shouldn't see; `asUser()` in a scheduled trigger fails because there is no user.

### Auth context vanishes outside an invocation
Timers and unawaited promises that fire after a handler returns lose their auth context (and may also be killed mid-flight). Don't `setTimeout` from a Forge function — push to an async queue (`@forge/events`) instead.

## Network & Security

### CSP blocks Custom UI by default
Custom UI is iframed with strict CSP. Symptoms: "Refused to load script", "Refused to connect to..."
- Declare every external host in `permissions.external.fetch.client` (frontend) or `permissions.external.fetch.backend` (resolvers).
- Inline `<script>` and inline event handlers are forbidden. Use `addEventListener` from a bundled file.
- Inline `<style>` *is* allowed in Custom UI HTML, but external stylesheets must also be allowlisted.

### `permissions.external.images` is separate from `fetch`
Images on `<img src=…>` need `permissions.external.images`, not `permissions.external.fetch`.

### Rate limiting (429)
Jira Cloud rate-limits REST. Symptoms: bursts of `429 Too Many Requests`.
- Implement exponential backoff with jitter (see `19-rate-limit-handling.md` and `24-production-patterns.md`).
- Honor `Retry-After` when present.
- Per-issue write limit: 20 writes / 2s. Burst limit: 100 writes/s. Plan chunked write-back accordingly.

## Storage & KVS

### Use `@forge/kvs`, not `storage` from `@forge/api`
The legacy `storage` API stopped receiving feature updates after **2025-03-17**. New apps should use `import { kvs } from '@forge/kvs'` (named import). Required scope: `storage:app`.

### KVS limits worth remembering
- 500-char key, regex `/^(?!\s+$)[a-zA-Z0-9:._\s-#]+$/`.
- 240 KiB per value, max object depth 31. **BYTES, not characters** — see below.
- 12 MB/s reads & 1 MB/s writes per key — shard hot keys.
- 24 MB/s queries per index value.
- See `27-faas-limits-and-cost.md` for what to do when you hit each.

### The 240 KiB value limit is BYTES; chunking by characters is a bug waiting for a German document

A payload split at `PART_CHARS` characters is only inside the limit for ASCII. A
character is 1–4 bytes in UTF-8, so the same code that works all through
development on English test data fails the first time a real customer uploads a
specification with umlauts in it — and it fails at the *write*, after the
expensive work that produced the payload is already done.

Either split on bytes, or pick a character size that is safe at the worst case:

```js
// 60_000 chars is inside 240 KiB even at UTF-8's 4-bytes-per-character worst case.
const PART_CHARS = 60_000;
```

The same applies to any per-item cap you derive from the value limit: count what
the platform counts.

### Secrets need `setSecret` / `getSecret`
Plain `kvs.set` is *not* encrypted at rest in the same way. Use `kvs.setSecret(key, value)` / `kvs.getSecret(key)` for credentials.

### KVS has no atomic compare-and-set (TOCTOU on locks)
`acquireLock` style check-then-set is racy: two callers who pass the check in the same window both `set`, last write wins. **There is no CAS primitive.** Narrow the window with **acquire-then-reread** (write, then re-read the holder; if someone else's write landed last, treat it as a lost race and back off) — but understand this does *not* eliminate the race. For exactly-once side effects use `keyPolicy: 'FAIL_IF_EXISTS'` (an atomic conditional create), see `26-async-events-and-queues.md`. Source: se-ppm `src/services/concurrency/write-lock.js:44-50`.

## Module Specifics

### Workflow validator error messages
`{ result: false, errorMessage: "..." }` — the field is `errorMessage`, not `message`. The user sees this string verbatim in the Jira UI.
- Keep messages short and actionable.
- Fail-open in `catch` blocks for external-dependency validators — never block a transition on your dependency's outage.

### `expression: "true"` is required on `jira:workflowCondition`
Without it, Jira treats the condition as static and **never invokes your Forge function** to compute transition-button visibility. With it, the function runs on every issue view — keep it cheap. See `25-workflow-modules-deep-dive.md`.

### Warm-container registry/cache staleness (~30 s)
A module-scoped cache (e.g. a disabled-rules registry read on the hot path) persists across invocations in a warm container. If you invalidate it only on the resolver write path, *another* warm container won't see the change — so a just-disabled rule can run for up to your cache TTL (~30 s in CogniRunner). Bounded staleness is fine for advisory data; never cache credentials this way (a stale key is binary-wrong).

### Custom UI: stale closures after `await`
React handlers that read a value *after* an `await` capture the value from render time, not the latest. For values you read post-await (latest payload, a token, an abort flag) store them in a `useRef` and read `.current`, or you'll act on stale state.

### Custom UI manifest layout: `basic` → `blank`
The Custom UI resource `layout: basic` was deprecated in 2025; use `layout: blank` for full-page Custom UI. Verify against the current manifest reference if a page renders with unexpected Atlassian chrome.

### Async events: v2 manifest shape
`@forge/events` v2 declares consumers with `function:` (not v1's `resolver:`). The v1 shape still works but is deprecated. See `26-async-events-and-queues.md`.

### Custom field rendering
`jira:customField` view rendering must use UI Kit (`@forge/react`, `render: native`). Custom UI is **not** supported for view rendering. Edit can use either.

### Workflow update is a full-replacement POST
Programmatically adding a rule to a workflow requires GET → modify entire definition in memory → POST the whole thing back. Forgetting any transition or omitting the `system:update-issue-status` post-function breaks the transition.

### Custom UI modal sizing
The `viewportSize` (`small`, `medium`, `large`) is a hint, not a strict cap. Test layouts in each size; complex forms feel cramped in `small`.

## FaaS Limits

| Surface | Default Timeout | Hard Ceiling |
|---|---|---|
| Resolver / trigger / validator / post-function | 25 s | 25 s |
| `consumer` / scheduled trigger function | 55 s default, set `timeoutSeconds:` to extend (limits-invocation page, verified 2026-09-14: "Default timeout is 55 seconds. Use timeoutSeconds to extend it.") | 900 s |
| `preUninstall` | 55 s (unverified — not stated on the limits-invocation page as of 2026-09-14) | 55 s (unverified) |
| `queue.push` payload | — | 50 events / 200 KB combined |
| `InvocationError.retryData` | — | 4 KB |
| Async retries | — | 4 retries |

If you need >25 s, push to an async queue. See `26-async-events-and-queues.md`.

## Bundling

### An ESM-only subpath export is a landmine in the backend bundle
The Forge backend bundler is **webpack 5, target node18, CommonJS output**. A
package whose subpath is exported only under the `import` condition resolves
fine in plain `node` and fails **only inside the bundle** — which is the one
place you cannot easily debug.

Real case: `unpdf` loads PDF.js with `await import("unpdf/pdfjs")`. Under
`require` conditions that throws `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`, surfacing to
the user as *"Serverless PDF.js bundle could not be resolved"* — which reads
like a corrupt PDF, not a build problem.

The fix removes both possible mechanisms rather than betting on which one bit:

```js
import * as pdfjsModule from "unpdf/pdfjs";   // STATIC — same chunk, no runtime resolution
import { definePDFJSModule } from "unpdf";
export const ensurePdfjs = () => definePDFJSModule(() => Promise.resolve(pdfjsModule));
```

Verify against the deployed bundle, never locally: this class of bug is invisible
in `node`.

### Async chunks land OUTSIDE the Custom UI resource directory
A Custom UI resource is a **directory** (`resources: [{key, path: src/chat/globalPage}]`).
Webpack emits async chunks next to `output.path`, which is usually the parent —
so `import()` anywhere in the frontend produces a chunk that **404s at runtime
with no useful error**. A third-party library doing `import()` internally
(tesseract.js does) cannot be fixed by a static import on your side.

```js
// webpack.config.js
module: {
  parser: { javascript: { dynamicImportMode: "eager" } },  // inline every import()
  rules: [...],
}
```

Beware: a second `module:` key silently replaces the first. Merge into the
existing block.

## Storage

### `kvs.query()` has no `sort()`
Only the **entity store** sorts. The plain KVS query exposes `where`, `limit`
and `cursor` — nothing else. Keys come back in an order the docs do not promise,
so `beginsWith(prefix).limit(50)` on `conv:<id>:msg:<timestamp>` returns the
**oldest** 50, not the newest.

Symptom in production: past 50 messages a chat silently stops showing the model
the user's newest turn, sidebar previews show the opening line forever, and a
message count saturates at exactly the limit. Maintain your own ordered index
instead, and back it with a cursor walk for rows that predate it.

Other shapes worth knowing: the cursor field is `nextCursor`; `batchGet` answers
`{successfulKeys, failedKeys}`; and TTL **is** supported —
`kvs.set(k, v, { ttl: { value: 30, unit: "DAYS" } })`.

### There is no compare-and-swap on a plain KVS key
`kvs.transact()`'s conditional `check` requires the **entity** store. On plain
keys, read-modify-write is all you have — so any value written concurrently WILL
lose writes.

Real case: an index array of uploaded files, updated by up to five concurrent
uploads. Each read `[]`, each wrote `[itself]`, last writer won, and the losers'
data rows were orphaned with nothing referencing them. The fix is structural,
not defensive: **one row per item**, enumerated with a prefix query. Separate
keys cannot collide.

### `beginsWith` matches more than you think
`upload:<id>` and `upload:<id>:c:<n>` share a prefix, and KVS has **no keys-only
projection** — every result carries its full value. A sweep over `upload:` to
find manifests therefore drags every chunk body through a 25-second resolver.
Give different record types **different key prefixes**, not different suffixes.

## Jira REST

### `GET /rest/api/3/field/{fieldId}` does not exist
It answers **405 Method Not Allowed** — "Method 'GET' is not supported" —
while `GET /rest/api/3/field` (the list form) succeeds on the same credentials.
Probed live; it is not a permissions problem. Any tool built on it can only ever
fail.

### `POST /issue/bulk` returns ONLY the successes in `body.issues`

The obvious mapping — `body.issues[n]` is the nth thing you sent — is wrong the
instant one element fails. Jira omits the rejected element from `issues`
entirely and reports it separately in `body.errors[]` by `failedElementNumber`,
so **every later success shifts down by one** and is recorded against the wrong
input.

It also answers **201 for a full success and 400 for a PARTIAL one**, with the
successes still present — so status alone must not decide either.

On a flat batch this is a mislabel. On a **hierarchy** it is not: if the next
pass resolves a child's parent through that same array, one rejected story
silently re-parents everything after it, and the user gets a tree that looks
plausible and is wrong.

```js
// Read the FAILURES first, then consume the successes against what is left.
const errs = Array.isArray(body?.errors) ? body.errors : [];
const failedPositions = new Set(errs.map((e) => Number(e?.failedElementNumber)).filter(Number.isInteger));
const made = Array.isArray(body?.issues) ? body.issues : [];
const survived = sent.map((s, pos) => ({ s, pos })).filter(({ pos }) => !failedPositions.has(pos));
if (made.length === survived.length) {
  made.forEach((m, n) => record(survived[n].s, m.key));
} else {
  // Counts disagree: Jira said something you do not understand. Record NOTHING
  // and report every entry as an honest failure — guessing is how the
  // mis-attribution comes back.
}
```

Also return the caller's original index with each created issue. Summaries are
neither unique nor echoed verbatim, so an index is the only reliable way back to
the input when the result array has been compacted.

### Bulk endpoints need the *Global bulk change* permission
`POST /rest/api/3/bulk/issues/fields`, `/transition` and `/move` all require it,
and ordinary users do not have it. Treat them as an admin-only accelerator and
translate the 403 into that sentence; the default path for "change N issues"
should be a capped sequential loop with partial-failure reporting.

### Creating components and versions needs `manage:jira-project`
If the app does not hold it, `setComponents` / `setFixVersions` can only use
values that already exist. Say so rather than failing on a name the user
invented.

### `archiveIssues` needs Premium/Enterprise AND admin
Under `asUser` it 403s for almost everyone. A tool that always fails is worse
than no tool.

### JQL is eventually consistent
`parent = KEY` can return **zero** seconds after the children were created,
while a direct `GET /issue/{key}` shows `fields.parent` set correctly. Verified
live. Read back **by key** after a write; an empty JQL result looks exactly like
"nothing was created", which is a completely different diagnosis.

Also: `~` is a **tokenised** text match, not a substring match. `summary ~ "a b"`
matches those words in any order and will not match the phrase you expect.
