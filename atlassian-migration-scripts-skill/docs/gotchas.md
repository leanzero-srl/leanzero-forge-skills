# Gotchas

Specific things that bite migration engineers. Each entry is something that has cost someone hours.

## Identity / users

- **Email is nullable.** `user.emailAddress === null` is normal for privacy-restricted users. Don't compare emails for equality without handling null.
- **Anonymized accounts** get aliases like `jirauser80900` as `displayName`. They aren't bugs; the user opted out of identity exposure.
- **`accountId` is 24 chars, with a colon.** `557058:f5fcdba9-...`. Don't truncate. Don't lowercase. Don't trim the colon.
- **Two users with the same `displayName`** is common in large tenants. Email is the only reliable disambiguator; when that's null, use the CSV override.
- **DC `username`/`userKey` don't exist in Cloud.** No `name` field in Cloud user responses. Don't reach for it.
- **`x-atlassian-force-account-id: true`** simulates the privacy-restricted world for testing. Turn it on for one staging run to see what breaks.

## Pagination

- **`startAt` returns 410 in Jira Cloud** after Aug 1, 2025. Use `POST /search/jql` + `nextPageToken`.
- **No `total` field on the new Jira pagination.** Progress bars need redesign.
- **Confluence v1 `start=N` pagination loops on large result sets.** Always follow `_links.next` and dedupe by content ID.
- **Confluence v2 uses Link header, not response body.** `Link: <url>; rel="next"` — parse it.
- **`nextPageToken` is opaque.** Don't base64-decode it; don't compare values; don't cache it between runs.

## Rate limits

- **March 2, 2026: Beta- prefix drops** on rate-limit headers, and overages return 429. Audit your scripts now.
- **Per-issue write limit (20/2s)** bites bulk comment imports — serialize per issue, parallelize across issues.
- **Bulk endpoints cost 1 point**, not 1 point per item. Use them.
- **5xx is exponential, 429 is `Retry-After`-first.** Confusing them leads to under-retrying 5xx or hammering 429.
- **Identity reads cost 2 points** (vs 1 for core reads). User-heavy plan phases burn the budget fast.

## ADF / page bodies

- **ADF `text` nodes with empty string** invalidate the document. Prune them.
- **No public ADF→text converter.** Use `?expand=renderedFields` for HTML; hand-roll or use a library for plaintext.
- **ADF version is always 1.** Don't omit the field; don't set it to 0.
- **`{ description: { add: ... } }` is not a thing.** Always `set` the whole ADF doc.
- **Storage format and ADF for the same page** are not byte-identical. Round-tripping through either loses information.
- **`updatePageStorage` returns 409** when another writer updated the page between your fetch and your PUT. Re-fetch, bump version, retry. Built into `cloud-confluence-client.js`.
- **Marks attach to `text` nodes**, not paragraph nodes. A link is `text` with a `link` mark.

## Attachments

- **`X-Atlassian-Token: no-check`** is required on every multipart attachment upload. **CORRECTED 2026-08-18 — MEASURED.** The status is NOT 403 on both products: Jira Cloud returns **404**, Confluence Cloud returns **403**, both with the 17-byte body `XSRF check failed`. Worse, that body is served as `content-type: application/json;charset=UTF-8` and is **not valid JSON**, so `JSON.parse(body).errorMessages` throws a `SyntaxError` and the operator never sees the words. Jira's 404 is also indistinguishable by status from "issue does not exist" (which returns a proper `errorMessages` body) — discriminate on the body, and guard the parse.
- **`GET /rest/api/3/attachment/content/{id}` answers 303, not 200 or 302** (Confluence's download endpoint answers **302**). MEASURED 2026-08-18. A follower matching only `301|302` writes a **zero-byte file** and returns status 303, which passes every `>= 400` check — and Jira Cloud then **accepts the zero-byte upload with HTTP 200**, so a count- or filename-keyed audit goes green on a migration that moved nothing.
- **Use `?redirect=false` on Jira attachment reads.** Documented and measured: returns **200** with the bytes on the API host, `content-length` set, supports `Range` (**206** + `content-range`), no cross-host hop, no signed URL, no expiry. Deletes the redirect follower from the Jira path entirely. **Confluence has no such parameter** — its spec's parameter list is `id`, `attachmentId`, `version`, `status` — so keep a 302-aware follower there.
- **The media redirect's signed URL lives 600 seconds** (`exp - nbf` on the JWT, measured; hard 403 `JwtAuthoriser:TokenExpiredError` shortly after). NEVER persist the resolved `api.media.atlassian.com` URL in a plan file — persist the stable `content` (Jira, absolute) / `downloadLink` (Confluence, **relative**, no host and no `/wiki` prefix). The query-string token is the ONLY credential: a garbage `Authorization` header still returns 200, stripping the token returns 401. So forwarding your API token on the redirect hop is a credential **disclosure**, not a failure — curl drops it across a host boundary, a hand-rolled recursive follower does not.
- **`GET /rest/api/3/configuration` does NOT return an attachment size limit.** MEASURED 2026-08-18: it returns `attachmentsEnabled: true` and no size field at all. You cannot preflight the limit there — pattern 28's advice to do so is wrong; defend on the 413 from the upload instead.
- **`100 MB default size limit`**, configurable up to 2 GB. Files >50 MB benefit from a longer HTTP timeout (≥5 min).
- **Match by filename + size + issue/page** when re-stitching attachment references — IDs change, this combo doesn't.
- **JCMA can pre-stage attachments** via "Migrate attachments in advance". Use it to shrink the cutover window.
- **`Buffer.concat([head, file, tail])` is not retry-safe.** Once the buffered body has been written to the socket, you can't replay it on a 429. Use a body-factory pattern that returns a fresh `Readable` each call — see `templates/multipart-builder.js` and pattern 31.
- **413 mid-upload reclassifies as `skipped-too-large`**, not `failed`. The tenant config can change between plan and execute time — but see the entry above: `GET /rest/api/3/configuration` does not carry a size limit, so the 413 from the upload is the only signal you actually get. Handle it.
- **DC attachment downloads issue 302/307 redirects to signed storage URLs.** Your downloader must follow them and re-apply auth. Forgetting `res.resume()` before recursing on the redirect leaves the socket half-read and the pool stalls.
- **Sanitize filenames for disk, not for the wire.** `/`, `\\`, ASCII control chars, `<>:|?*"` are illegal on at least one major filesystem. Store as `dcId__sanitized-name`; use the original name in the multipart `Content-Disposition`.
- **Filename + size fingerprint** must be re-checked at execute time. Another worker (or another sub-project running in parallel) may have uploaded the same file between plan and execute.
- **`POST /attachments` returns an array of 1**, not a single object. Pull `result[0].id` not `result.id`.

## CSV / file I/O

- **UTF-8 BOM** at the start of CSVs makes Excel and Numbers open them correctly. The `csv-writer.js` template adds it by default.
- **CSV with embedded newlines** needs the value wrapped in quotes. RFC 4180. The template handles this.
- **`fs.appendFileSync` blocks the event loop.** Use it sparingly during long runs; better to keep a `WriteStream` open.
- **`logs/` files are gitignored** — don't accidentally share `logs/cache_users.json` with colleagues; it contains accountIds.

## Date math

- **Atlassian APIs return UTC offsets**, not raw timestamps. `2026-05-18T08:34:12.117+0000` is UTC; `+0200` is two hours east of UTC.
- **`Date.now()`** gives ms since epoch — monotonically increasing but jumps on system clock changes. Don't run two migrations on the same machine within the same millisecond (use a monotonic counter if you need stability).
- **JQL date filters** are in the tenant's timezone, not UTC. `due > "2026-05-01"` might miss what you expect if your tenant is set to UTC+10.

## Forge KVS

- **`kvs.query` and `list-keys` are eventually consistent.** Use `kvs.get` for read-then-write workflows.
- **Key length is 255 bytes.** Hash long keys; don't truncate (you'll collide).
- **Value depth is ~10 levels.** Flatten deeply nested objects.
- **`appSystemToken: true` plus scopes** is non-negotiable for remote access. Missing either → 401.
- **The system token has a 55+ minute validity.** Don't cache it — Atlassian rotates it per-invocation.

## CLI flag handling

- **`--limit 0` means "no limit"** in this skill's vocabulary. Don't accidentally pass `--limit 0` thinking it means "zero entries".
- **`--dry-run` and `--confirm` are not mutually exclusive.** Dry-run wins (safer default).
- **`--retry-failed` only applies in `--execute-only` mode.** It's a no-op in a fresh plan run.
- **`--space` is repeatable** but `--space DOCS,KB` (comma-separated) also works. Mix freely.

## Cookies, agents, and sessions

- **Don't reuse a single `https.Agent` between DC and Cloud clients.** Cookies aren't host-portable.
- **The default Node agent pool maxSockets is `Infinity`.** A migration script with high concurrency can open thousands of sockets — cap if you see file-descriptor errors.
- **`keepAlive: true`** speeds up tight loops but can hold sockets open past process exit. The templates use the default (`keepAlive: false`).

## Forge tunnel / local dev

- **The Forge tunnel doesn't pick up manifest changes** automatically. Stop, `forge install --upgrade`, restart.
- **A locally-tunneled function still uses real Cloud KVS** — don't experiment with `kvs.set("test", ...)` against a production environment.

## Plan files

- **`plan_<runId>.json.tmp`** lingering after a crash is safe to delete. The next save will recreate it.
- **Two scripts editing the same plan** corrupt it. PlanManager is not multi-process safe.
- **Loading a plan from a different runId** is fine — just pass `--plan-file <path>`.
- **Hand-editing a plan JSON** is allowed but discouraged. Use `patchEntry` programmatically when possible.

## Atlassian Connect (legacy)

- **`AP.context.getToken()`** is Connect, not Forge, not Cloud REST. Don't copy it from old docs.
- **Locally-signed JWT** against a shared secret is also Connect. Don't.
- **Connect is being phased out.** New work targets Forge or external REST clients with API tokens.

## JQL / AQL gotchas (post-JCMA)

- **`Customer Request Type` was renamed `Request Type`.** JCMA does this on every JSM project. Sanitize the JQL or the filter parser rejects it.
- **~~`not in (Foo, Bar)` fails on Cloud.~~ STRUCK 2026-08-12 — MEASURED FALSE.** `POST /rest/api/3/jql/parse?validation=strict` on a live Cloud site ACCEPTS `labels not in (Test, TEST)`: lowercase operators and bare single-token values are both fine. What actually fails is a bare value **containing a space** (`status = In Progress` → "You must surround 'In' in quotation marks"). The `jqlSanitizer` uppercasing/quoting passes are cosmetic, not correctness fixes — keep them for canonical form, but do not budget rework for them.
- **`standardIssueTypes` without parens fails.** DC accepted it as a function reference; Cloud requires `standardIssueTypes()`. Other paren-less names that need fixing: `subTaskIssueTypes`, `votedIssues`, `watchedIssues`, `issueHistory`.
- **Year-quarter labels collide with placeholder syntax.** Values like `2019Q4`, `2020Q1` *will* break a naive `Q(\d+)` placeholder regex if you use control-char placeholders without proper delimiters. Use SOH/STX (`\x01` / `\x02`) — they cannot legally appear in user-authored JQL.
- **AQL inside `aqlFunction("...")` is a different language.** Don't rewrite numeric IDs inside it with the JQL rewriter — handle AQL bodies separately with `rewriteAqlFunctionBodies`.
- **Filter references to deleted entities** can't be auto-rewritten. Surface in the failed CSV; don't fail the whole run.
- **~~`cf[N]` and `customfield_N` are interchangeable.~~ STRUCK 2026-08-12 — MEASURED FALSE ON CLOUD.** Cloud's JQL parser accepts `cf[10015]` and the field NAME, and REJECTS `customfield_10015` ("Field 'customfield_10015' does not exist"). Proof from the tenant itself: `GET /rest/api/3/field` returns `clauseNames: ["cf[10015]", "Start date", "Start date[Date]"]` — checked all 188 custom fields on a live site and **not one** advertises a `customfield_N` clause name. Still sanitize both forms in DC-authored input, but the output must be `cf[N]` or the name, never `customfield_N`.

## Storage format & ADF gotchas

- **Storage format `<root>` wrappers.** When parsing Confluence storage with fast-xml-parser, wrap in a fake `<root>` element first — naked XHTML fragments aren't valid XML. Strip the `<root>` wrapper on serialize.
- **`preserveOrder: true` is non-negotiable** for fast-xml-parser when rewriting storage XHTML. Without it, attribute order changes between input and output, breaking byte equality of unchanged regions.
- **ADF `text` nodes with empty string** invalidate the document. Always call `adf.prune(doc)` before serializing.
- **ADF marks attach to text, not paragraphs.** `{type: "link", attrs: {href}}` goes inside `marks[]` on a `text` node — not on the containing paragraph.
- **`@_ac:macro-id` vs `ac:macro-id`** depends on fast-xml-parser's `attributeNamePrefix`. The conventions in our `storage-format-parser.js` template use `@_` — match that or override.
- **Confluence storage attribute order is significant for some macros.** Many vendor macros assume parameters appear in a specific order. Don't sort.
- **ADF `version: 1`** at the root is mandatory. Omitting it silently breaks the document.

## Backup & rollback gotchas

- **Confluence rollback via `?status=historical&version=N` is v1-API only.** v2 doesn't expose historical body fetches in a single call. Use v1 for rollback even if the rest of your code targets v2.
- **`currentVersion > recordedVersion`** at rollback time means a third party edited the page after your sync. **Refuse to clobber** — surface to the operator.
- **Per-entity Jira backups are not atomic** — between snapshot and mutation, automation rules can fire. The "pre-state" you saved may not match what's there a moment later. Re-snapshot inside the worker if a mutation is sensitive.
- **`backups/<runId>/` can balloon.** A 150k-issue plan with full-fields snapshots is gigabytes. Either select specific fields (`fields=summary,description,customfield_X`) or drop snapshots after a clean audit.

## Identity resolution edge cases

- **`x-atlassian-force-account-id: true`** simulates the privacy-restricted world. Run with this header for one staging run before doing the real one.
- **Anonymized accounts can't be looked up by email** — their email is `null`. Display-name search still works.
- **Display names are not unique.** Two users with the same display name → `multiMatch: true`. Use the CSV override file.
- **Group lookup endpoints differ.** Jira: `GET /rest/api/3/group?groupname=X`. Confluence: `GET /rest/api/group/picker?query=X` (the legacy `by-name` endpoint was removed and returns 410).

## Instance fingerprinting

- **Always stamp the instance signature** at plan creation time. Re-using a plan against the wrong tenant is one of the worst migration accidents.
- **Empty `sourceBaseUrl`** is valid (Cloud→Cloud, no DC) — the fingerprint matches on whatever URLs are present.
- **`--allow-instance-mismatch` should require operator confirmation.** Don't make it the default. Logging "DANGEROUS" in the warning isn't enough; consider an interactive prompt for the manual override.

## Cloud catalog gotchas

- **The catalog cache is per-machine.** Two operators running on different machines have different caches. If a custom field is added between their runs, only one will see it. Have a `--refresh-catalog` flag.
- **Group lookups are paginated.** The first `/rest/api/3/groups/picker?query=` call returns up to 200; you may need multiple calls (paginate by first character) to get all of them on tenants with >200 groups.
- **Status names can collide across workflows.** "Done" exists in many workflows but may have different IDs in each. The catalog returns the first match — use `statusId` from the issue you're updating, not the catalog, if precision matters.

## Owner-swap gotchas

- **`ownerSwap` is NOT self-safe** — the bare swap+restore primitive doesn't guarantee anything. Use `withOwnerSwap` (the wrapper template) which puts swap/mutate/restore inside try/finally.
- **Orphaned swaps must be logged.** If the restore fails (network blip, 5xx, race), you've left the entity owned by the wrong person. Always write the orphan to `logs/orphan_owner_swaps.csv` so it surfaces for manual cleanup — never swallow the error.
- **Dashboard owner-swap requires a full PUT body.** Unlike filter, there's no dedicated `/dashboard/{id}/owner` endpoint. You have to GET the existing dashboard, send all fields back unchanged except `owner` — and ANY changes a third party made between your GET and PUT get clobbered.
- **Test that you have site-admin before relying on owner-swap.** Without site-admin, even owner-swap fails — there's no "operate as another user" privilege in Cloud comparable to DC's `SUDO`.

## Asset / CMDB / Insight gotchas

- **ARI shape:** `ari:cloud:cmdb::object/<workspaceId>/<objectId>`. The double-colon (`cmdb::object`) is intentional — an empty `cloudId` segment is the canonical form. Some older docs show `ari:cloud:cmdb:<workspaceId>:object/<id>` — that's the older 4-segment form and Cloud's parser accepts both but emits the new form.
- **Multiple Cloud objects can share a name.** Asset names are not unique within a workspace. If you rewrite a bare-name JQL value, you might match multiple objects on Cloud where DC matched one. The `asset-field-rewriter.js` template only rewrites tokens with EXPLICIT identification (key, objectId, ARI) — never bare names — to avoid this.
- **`Key` vs `Name`:** in AQL, `Key = "CI-21171"` is the object key; `Name = "Native Makers"` is the display name. These are different fields. Don't confuse the JCMA-renamed asset name with the asset key.
- **Workspace ID changes between tenants.** If you copy filter JQL from one Cloud site to another, ARI workspaceIds inside `aqlFunction("...")` need rewriting too.
- **20-asset cap per ticket field.** Jira Cloud enforces a maximum of 20 asset references per custom field per issue. If a DC issue had 50 assets in one field, you have to drop / split / pick the top 20.

## Preflight gotchas

- **Preflight is read-only — but the comparator can be expensive.** A naive comparator that re-fetches every field of every entry hits rate limits fast. Cache the source side; only fetch what the comparator needs.
- **Drift threshold is a heuristic.** 10% might be wildly too high for security-sensitive migrations and wildly too low for cosmetic field renames. Tune per migration.
- **Negative-cache poisoning.** If a temporary network failure during preflight returns "fetch-error" for many entries, they look like drift. Distinguish `fetch-error` from `drift` in the bucket counts so the operator can re-run preflight without re-planning.

## Stable cursor sorting

- **`updated DESC` is the most common pagination bug.** It feels natural ("newest first") but every save shifts the order. Use `key ASC`, `id ASC`, or `created ASC` instead.
- **Stable sort isn't the same as deterministic.** You can sort by `key ASC` and still see different results across runs if issues were added or deleted between runs. Stable cursors just mean *within a single run*, the cursor advances cleanly.
- **JQL's `ORDER BY ASC` is the default direction.** You can omit `ASC` for brevity; `DESC` must be explicit.

## Workflow migration

- **Status names are not unique across workflows.** Two workflows can both have "Done"; their IDs differ. Build the status remap per-workflow, not per-tenant.
- **Read-only properties on statuses:** `name`, `issueEditable`, `statusCategory` are not accepted on the create/update payloads. Strip them before sending.
- **ScriptRunner workflow rules don't migrate.** Cloud has no ScriptRunner-on-Cloud unless the customer pays for the Connect app, and even then the rule shapes differ. Drop ScriptRunner conditions/validators/post-functions with an audit trail.
- **JMWE prefix double-encoding:** JCMA sometimes emits `jmwe-cloud:jmwe-cloud:<rule>` for JMWE rule keys. Strip the duplicated prefix before sending or Cloud rejects the rule.
- **System post-functions** (UpdateIssueStatusFunction, FireIssueEventFunction, etc.) are Cloud-managed — don't include them in your `postFunctions[]` payload; Cloud adds them automatically.
- **Workflow transitions must reference statuses by `id`, not name.** The bulk update API will accept names but silently lose information; use IDs.

## Cloud-to-Cloud config differences

- **"Customer Request Type" → "Request Type"** on every Cloud JSM project — see jqlSanitizer's default rename. Be aware this rename happened both on the source AND destination if both are Cloud.
- **Issue-type hierarchy level differs across plans.** Free tier doesn't have epics; Premium does. A source with epics may need its issue-type scheme adjusted on the destination.
- **Priority schemes are tenant-scoped.** A "P1" priority on tenant A is a different entity from "P1" on tenant B even with identical names. Build a remap, even for trivial-looking cases.
- **Link types use both `inward` and `outward` labels.** Compare both — a `blocks`/`is blocked by` pair can have either side renamed independently.

## Excel report writer

- **Sheet names ≤ 31 chars, no `:\\/?*[]`.** Sanitize before adding. The `excel-report-writer.js` template does this automatically.
- **`exceljs` isn't zero-dep.** The skill's other templates use no runtime deps; this is the one place we break that rule. Use CSVs unless operators specifically need Excel formatting.
- **Auto-width is approximate.** ExcelJS doesn't measure actual rendered text width; it estimates from char count. Cap at 60 chars to avoid runaway columns.
- **Status fills need full ARGB hex codes** (`FFC6EFCE`, not `C6EFCE`). The template prepends the alpha automatically.

## Stratified sampling

- **Stratifying by bucket biases the audit toward over-represented categories** when buckets are very uneven. Either normalize (cap N per bucket) or accept the bias — never claim a stratified sample is "representative" without saying *of what*.
- **Mulberry32 seed reproducibility holds across machines** as long as no in-process state changes the seed. Don't call `mulberry32(Date.now())` — that's not seeded.

## Discovery dump

- **Discovery dumps can leak content.** Raw storage XHTML and macro JSON can contain user-identifiable information. Treat the dump directory like `logs/` — gitignored, not shared in tickets.

## Running and monitoring (agent observation)

- **`tail -f` inside an agent tool call never returns.** Use bounded snapshots (`tail -50`) at intervals instead.
- **`kill -9` skips Node's signal handlers** — the autosave window of work is lost. Use Ctrl+C / SIGTERM and let the script flush.
- **The `FINAL REPORT` string is the completion marker.** Greppable, stable across sub-projects.
- **Progress lines arrive every ~25 entries.** Absence for ≥ 5× the normal gap means a 429 storm or a slow upload — wait, then verify with `lsof -p <pid>`.
- **The `master_<runId>.json`** is the canonical resume pointer, not the `plan_<runId>.json` directly. Always pass `--plan-file logs/master_<runId>.json` so the script can reload both the index and the entries.
- **Background-running long jobs is mandatory** for populations >100 entities. A foreground tool call holds the agent's turn for the entire run.

## JSM actor / role gotchas

- **`Service Desk Team` role, not site-admin.** A JSM mutation that runs as an actor (automation rule import, asset/ticket association, transition, comment) fails `400 component.missing.permissions.actor` unless the actor is in the project's `Service Desk Team` (agent) role. Being a Jira/site admin is NOT enough.
- **`/mypermissions` lies.** `GET /rest/api/3/mypermissions` can report `havePermission: true` for EDIT_ISSUES/TRANSITION_ISSUES even when the automation engine will reject the actor. Trust real role membership, not the permissions endpoint.
- **App actors use a different role.** "Run rule as Jira" / Automation-for-Jira app actors (accountId prefix `557058:`) act through `atlassian-addons-project-access`, granted via the **permission scheme** — not the Service Desk Team role. Dedupe scheme grants by scheme id (schemes are shared across projects).
- **Role ids aren't stable.** Resolve the role id per project, by name, every time.
- **Assets `cmdb.object.create` object-type ids are workspace-local.** They don't remap with the generic field-mapper; remap by `schemaLabel::objectTypeLabel`, or create fails with "User does not have permission to create rule with this object type."

## Automation rule migration gotchas

- **DC has no Automation REST API.** A GET against the Cloud automation path returns `{}` on Data Center; rules live behind the UI/WebSudo. DC→Cloud must be hybrid: manual UI export → bash mapping gen → node transform/import.
- **import dedupes by rule NAME.** `import_clean.js` skips any source rule whose name already exists on the target. Per-project copies of a same-named rule are silently skipped after the first — rename uniquely if you need all copies.
- **`state` on create is not reliably honored.** After `POST .../rest/v1/rule`, enforce ENABLED/DISABLED with an explicit enable/disable call.
- **Cross-site app actors 400.** The source rule's actor (`557058:<source-uuid>`) doesn't exist on the target → set the target's app actor (auto-discovered) or `ACTOR_OVERRIDE`/`APP_ACTOR`.
- **Email-action rules import DISABLED** regardless of source state — re-enable deliberately so a half-migrated tenant can't blast notifications.
- **Cloud field list incompleteness:** `GET /rest/api/3/field` omits some fields on some tenants; use `GET /rest/api/3/field/search?type=custom` (paginated) for a complete custom-field list.

## Post-JCMA issue-recovery gotchas

- **DC and Cloud search differ.** DC `/rest/api/2/search` takes `startAt` and allows `maxResults=1000` with `fields=*none`; Cloud `/rest/api/3/search/jql` has no `startAt`, uses an opaque `nextPageToken`, and caps at **100/page**. Mixing them up under-reports missing issues.
- **Re-keyed ≠ missing.** A moved/re-created Cloud issue keeps its old key as a **label** and resolves by `key = "OLD"` via its move-alias. Check both before counting a key missing, and always apply a `created < MIGRATION_CUTOFF` filter.
- **CSV importer key preservation is conditional.** The System CSV importer keeps the original key only if it's still **FREE**; if TAKEN it silently **EDITs** the existing issue. Re-run `check_keys_free` right before import.
- **REST create cannot set the key.** The next-in-counter issue keeps its key; below-counter issues get a new key with the old key kept as a label.
- **Status names must match exactly.** The importer matches status by exact name; DC Title Case vs Cloud sentence case silently fails the row — build a per-project status-name map.
- **`createmeta` under-reports required fields.** Validator/behaviour/ScriptRunner-enforced fields show `required: false`; discover the real set by trial-create, then delete the probe issue.
- **JCMA truncates descriptions > 65k chars.** Long issue descriptions are cut at the field limit; recover the full text from the DC source (e.g. rebuild as a DOCX attachment) rather than trusting the migrated body.

## Confluence app-macro migration gotchas

- **App macros collide with native macro names.** JCMA can land Appfire Composition `deck`/`card` as raw storage names that collide with native Cloud macros and break rendering. Rewrite to `tab-group`/`tab` in storage format.
- **Default-deny on ambiguous macros.** A CQL hit on `macro = "card"` is not proof it's the app macro — Cloud has its own `card`. Only rewrite with positive evidence (Composition ancestor or shaped param); skip the rest with a recorded reason.
- **Splice rewrites must run back-to-front.** Apply edits descending by span start, or earlier rewrites shift later offsets.
- **Record the server-truth post-PUT version.** A 409 retry that raced a third-party edit lands at `freshVersion + 2`, not `+1`. Recording `result.newVersion` keeps rollback from clobbering the third party's edit.

## Org-level account operations

- **Account suspension/removal is ORG-admin, not tenant-admin.** It runs against the Atlassian Admin API (`https://api.atlassian.com/admin/v1/orgs/{orgId}/...`) with an **org admin API key**, not a Jira/Confluence API token. Suspend = `POST .../directory/users/{accountId}/suspend-access`; remove = `DELETE .../directory/users/{accountId}` (async, permanent). See `atlassian-organizations-api-skill`.
- **Filter by `account_type` first.** Only `atlassian` accounts are staff; skip `customer` (JSM portal users) and `app` (Connect/Forge service accounts) unless you explicitly mean to touch them.
- **`GET /users` only returns *managed* accounts.** Invited-but-unclaimed users (a different email domain) never appear there. Use `POST /v1/orgs/{orgId}/users/search` to cover both. (Search endpoint deprecated after 2026-06-30 — acceptable for a one-off migration script; verify before reuse.)
- **Privacy-restricted accounts have no email.** They're skipped silently — you can't safely match a domain without an email.

## Custom-field audit gotchas (MEASURED 2026-08-12 on a live Cloud site)

- **A dead field reference counts to ZERO, not to an error.** `cf[99999] is not EMPTY` and
  `cf[99999] is EMPTY` both return **HTTP 200, count 0** from `approximate-count` AND from
  `POST /search/jql`. A bogus clause is not dropped either — `project = X AND cf[99999] is EMPTY`
  returns 0, not the project total. Every DELETE branch of the `(migrated)` field decision matrix
  in `17-post-jcma-audit-endpoints.md` is triggered by a zero, so a stale ID recommends deleting a
  populated field. Gate before you recommend.
- **~~`is EMPTY` + `is not EMPTY` == scope count proves the reference is live.~~ TOO WEAK — do not
  use it as the gate.** Swept all 197 custom fields on a live site: 167 partition cleanly, **20
  return HTTP 400** (not JQL-searchable), **9 live fields sum to 0** (4× `SLA CustomField Type`,
  Responders, Forms, Design, Vulnerability, Location) and **1 sums short** (`Team`, off by 4
  subtasks in a team-managed project). On a real JSM tenant this reports populated SLA fields as
  unused. Keep it as a WARNING; make the catalogue lookup + name assertion the gate.
- **`GET /rest/api/3/field` lists a custom field only after it has been put on a SCREEN**, and the
  inclusion is then permanent (verified: create → absent; add to screen → present in ~5s; remove
  from screen → still present). It reported 188 custom fields where `GET /rest/api/3/field/search?type=custom`
  reported 197. This supersedes the vaguer note under "Automation rule migration gotchas" — the
  rule is screen association, not tenant flakiness. **Always use `field/search` for a catalogue.**
- **`field/search` does NOT return `clauseNames`.** It carries `id`, `name`, `schema`,
  `typeDisplayName`, `description`, `areOptionsSupported`, `isOptionsCountOverLimit` and the
  translated variants. Use `typeDisplayName` for type assertions — **do not** derive a type from
  `schema.custom.split(":").pop()`; several fields have no colon in that string at all.
- **`GET /field` reports `searchable: true` for fields that 400 on every JQL clause.** Do not trust it.
- **`approximate-count` rejects an unbounded query AND a trailing `ORDER BY`.** Plan scopes routinely
  carry a sort; strip it before wrapping, or you get a 400 on `(project = X ORDER BY created) AND ...`.
  Use `created >= "1970-01-01"` as the tautological "everything" bound.
- **`jql/parse?validation=strict` is NOT a safe preflight.** It rejects `customfield_10015 is not EMPTY`
  (which search resolves correctly, returning the same count as `cf[10015]`), and it rejects real
  fields that have no screen/context yet. Two independent false-alarm modes.
- **DC-era IDs are recoverable.** JCMA 1.11.4+ exposes a documented (beta) serverId→cloudId mapping
  API — pull and persist it rather than rebuilding the map by name matching.
- **Cloud→Cloud is NOT a JCMA job.** Atlassian scopes JCMA to Server/Data Center sources only. The
  C2C route is Atlassian Administration → **Data management → Data transfer → Create copy plan**.
  And because both tenants mint custom-field IDs sequentially from 10000 (97/100 slots occupied in
  the first band on a 197-field site), a wrong ID on C2C returns a **plausible count for a different
  field**, not a zero — only a name/type assertion catches it.
