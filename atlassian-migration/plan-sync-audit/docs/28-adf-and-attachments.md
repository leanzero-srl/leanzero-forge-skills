# ADF & Attachments

The two body-format pitfalls of every Jira / Confluence migration: ADF for descriptions and comments, and attachment uploads that fail without a CSRF header.

## ADF — Atlassian Document Format

Jira v3 returns and accepts rich-text fields (descriptions, comments, custom-field text values) as **ADF JSON**. Not wiki markup. Not HTML.

Example minimal ADF document:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "type": "doc",
  "content": [
    { "type": "paragraph",
      "content": [
        { "type": "text", "text": "Hello world." }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The full spec lives at <https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/apis/document/structure/>.

### Rules for migration scripts

1. **`set`, not `add`.** When writing a description or comment, send the *whole* ADF document. There is no public "append to ADF" API. `PUT /rest/api/3/issue/{key}` accepts:
   ```json
   { "fields": { "description": <full ADF doc> } }
   ```
   `update` operations like `{ description: [{ add: ... }] }` are not supported.

2. **There is no public ADF↔text/wiki converter.** Atlassian doesn't expose one. If your source is wiki markup or HTML, you have to convert it client-side. Options:
   - **`?expand=renderedFields`** — Jira returns `renderedFields.description` as HTML. Useful for read-only display, not for round-tripping.
   - **Hand-roll the conversion** — feasible if your source format is simple (plaintext with a few link patterns).
   - **Library** — `adf-builder` (~70k weekly downloads) wraps the JSON construction in a fluent API. Outside the zero-dep philosophy, but worth it if you build many ADF docs.

3. **`text` nodes can't be empty.** `{ type: "text", text: "" }` is invalid — Confluence/Jira reject the whole document. Filter empties before serializing:
   ```javascript
   function pruneEmptyText(node) {
     if (node.type === "text" && !node.text) return null;
     if (Array.isArray(node.content)) {
       node.content = node.content.map(pruneEmptyText).filter(Boolean);
     }
     return node;
   }
   ```

4. **Always send `version: 1`** at the root. Future versions may exist; for now, hardcode 1.

5. **Marks attach to `text` nodes, not paragraph nodes.** A link is `{type: "text", text: "...", marks: [{type: "link", attrs: {href: "..."}}]}`.

### Common ADF node builders

Drop these helpers into a sub-project's `src/adfBuilders.js` when needed:

```javascript
const paragraph = (...inline) => ({ type: "paragraph", content: inline });

const text = (s, marks = []) =>
  marks.length ? { type: "text", text: s, marks } : { type: "text", text: s };

const link = (s, href) => text(s, [{ type: "link", attrs: { href } }]);

const mention = (accountId, displayName) => ({
  type: "mention",
  attrs: { id: accountId, text: `@${displayName}`, accessLevel: "" },
});

const heading = (level, ...inline) => ({
  type: "heading",
  attrs: { level },
  content: inline,
});

const doc = (...blocks) => ({ version: 1, type: "doc", content: blocks });
```

Build the document, JSON.stringify, send.

### Storage format (Confluence-only)

Confluence pages have two body formats:

- **`storage`**: XHTML-like XML with custom `<ac:structured-macro>` elements. Legacy but stable; the format Atlassian's editor compiles into. Best for surgical macro rewrites where you want to preserve unknown attributes.
- **`atlas_doc_format`**: ADF JSON. Same as Jira's. The new default.

The `cloud-confluence-client.js` template ships both `updatePageStorage` and `updatePageAdf`. Pick by the kind of edit:

| Edit | Use |
|---|---|
| Replace a macro / fix a parameter / change an attribute | `storage` (XHTML surgery is easier) |
| Replace whole-document body | `atlas_doc_format` (modern, future-proof) |
| Anchored text references | Either; `atlas_doc_format` is more uniform |

## Attachments

Jira and Confluence attachment uploads use `multipart/form-data` and the same critical header:

```
X-Atlassian-Token: no-check
```

Without it, the request is rejected by Atlassian's CSRF filter with HTTP 403 — and the error message doesn't say "CSRF". Common operator confusion when they first see a 403 without an obvious permission cause.

### Jira attachment upload

```
POST /rest/api/3/issue/{issueIdOrKey}/attachments
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=...
X-Atlassian-Token: no-check

(form field name="file", filename="...", binary contents)
```

The `cloud-jira-client.js` template implements this as:

```javascript
const result = await jira.uploadAttachment(issueKey, "report.pdf", buffer);
// → [{ id, filename, size, mimeType, content, thumbnail, author, created, ... }]
```

### Confluence attachment upload

```
POST /wiki/rest/api/content/{pageId}/child/attachment
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=...
X-Atlassian-Token: no-check
```

Same shape; different path. The `cloud-confluence-client.js` template does NOT currently ship this helper — implement per-job based on the Jira pattern.

### Attachment migration patterns

JCMA's **"Migrate attachments in advance"** feature can pre-stage binaries from your DC instance to Cloud storage before cutover. This shortens the cutover window dramatically — only the metadata (issue↔attachment links) needs to be applied on cutover day.

For post-JCMA mending where attachment IDs changed:

1. Build a `{sourceAttachmentId: destAttachmentId}` mapping (use issue key + filename + size as the join key).
2. Re-stitch references in custom fields, descriptions, comments, or app data.
3. Don't re-upload — wastes storage and bandwidth.

#### Re-uploading missing attachments

If JCMA left attachments behind (which it does silently for files that were uploaded to DC between JCMA's snapshot and cutover, or for issues moved between projects, or when a vendor app intercepts attachment storage), use the **`sync_issue_attachments`** pattern from `VAL-migration-scripts/jira/jira-data/`:

```javascript
// PLAN: discover the gap
const cloudAtt = await cloud.listAttachments(issueKey);     // primed from JQL response if possible
const dcAtt    = await dc.getIssueAttachments(issueKey).attachments;
const cloudFps = new Set(cloudAtt.map((a) => `${a.filename}::${a.size}`));
const missing  = dcAtt.filter((a) => !cloudFps.has(`${a.filename}::${a.size}`));

// EXECUTE: download → upload, one attachment at a time
for (const att of missing) {
  const tempPath = `/tmp/${issueKey}__${att.id}__${sanitize(att.filename)}`;
  await dc.downloadAttachmentToFile(att.content, tempPath);
  const result = await cloud.uploadAttachment(issueKey, tempPath, att.filename, att.mimeType);
  fs.unlinkSync(tempPath);
}
```

Five things this pattern gets right that a naive script doesn't:

1. **Filename + byte-size fingerprint** (`filename::size`) — see pattern 33. Filename alone collides; ID won't survive migration.
2. **Streaming download → disk → upload**, not buffer-in-memory. Big attachments (10s of MB) OOM the script otherwise.
3. **Retry-safe multipart factory** — see pattern 31. Without it, a 429 mid-upload kills the run.
4. **Per-attachment status nested in per-issue plan row.** Resume picks up at the exact attachment, not at the issue.
5. **Re-check fingerprints at execute time** — between plan and execute, another worker (or another script run) may have uploaded the same file.

See `templates/multipart-builder.js` for the upload helper and `docs/24-production-patterns.md#31-35` for the full set of patterns.

### Attachment size limits

- Jira Cloud default: 100 MB per file.
- Confluence Cloud default: 100 MB per file.
- Both can be raised to 2 GB in tenant settings, but uploads >100 MB go through a different storage path and may time out the API client.

For files >50 MB, raise the HTTP client timeout to 5+ minutes:

```javascript
options.timeout = 5 * 60 * 1000;
```
