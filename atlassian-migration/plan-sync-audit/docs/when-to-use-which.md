# When to Use Which

Decision trees for choosing the right pattern, endpoint, or sub-skill for the job at hand.

## What kind of job is this?

```
Are you discovering source state?
├── Yes → plan-script.template.js
│         (read source, write logs/plan_<runId>.json + plan_<runId>.csv)
│
Are you applying changes to a destination?
├── Yes → sync-script.template.js
│         (load plan, apply changes, two-gate safety)
│
Are you verifying changes landed?
├── Yes → audit-script.template.js
│         (sample, compare expected vs actual, write audit_<runId>.csv)
│
Are you doing something that doesn't fit any phase?
└── Use a one-shot script in tools/ (no plan, no audit — operator owns the risk)
```

## Is this a job for this skill?

```
Does JCMA already do this?
├── Yes → run JCMA; only come here for post-cutover cleanup
│
Is it a Forge app you're building?
├── Yes → use atlassian-jira-forge-skill or atlassian-confluence-forge-skill
│
Is it a one-off curl?
├── Yes → just use curl or `gh api`
│
Is it ongoing automation (not a migration)?
├── Yes → build a Forge app or an external service with proper monitoring
│
Is it a bulk, one-shot data fixup against Atlassian Cloud?
└── Yes → this skill is the right tool
```

**Scope note — Bitbucket is not covered.** This skill covers Jira (incl. JSM) and Confluence migration scripting. Bitbucket Cloud Migration Assistant (BBMA) repository/PR migration is out of scope — there is no Bitbucket content here yet. The Plan/Sync/Audit triad and HTTP-client patterns would transfer, but the entity model (repos, refs, PRs, pipelines) and BBMA's API surface are different enough that they'd need their own grounding before this skill should claim to cover them.

## Plan-only, execute-only, or both?

```
Plan size: how many entries are you migrating?
├── < 50           → run with no flags (plan + execute in one go)
├── 50 – 1,000     → --plan-only, eyeball logs/plan_*.csv, then --execute-only
└── > 1,000        → --plan-only, attach CSV to change ticket, --execute-only later

Are you in a maintenance window with a deadline?
├── Yes → --plan-only ahead of the window, --execute-only on the day
└── No  → flexible — pick based on data size
```

## Native `https` or a library?

```
Are you in this skill's templates?
└── Yes → native https — zero deps is non-negotiable

Are you outside the skill's templates, doing migration-adjacent work?
├── Need predictable retries → still native https; copy the retry state machine
├── Need HTTP/2 / brotli / DNS caching → undici
├── Want the smallest readable code → got v14
└── Don't reach for axios — its config is harder to audit
```

## Bulk endpoint or per-entity loop?

```
How many entities are you reading?
├── < 50    → either works; per-entity is simpler
├── 50–100  → bulk wins on rate-limit cost
└── > 100   → bulk is mandatory; loop the bulk call with batches of 100

Are you creating issues?
├── 1–10   → individual POST /issue
├── 11–50  → POST /issue/bulk (one call)
└── > 50   → POST /issue/bulk, batched (≤50 per call)

Are you deleting issues?
└── Always use POST /bulk/issues/delete (≤1000 per call, even for one)
```

## Storage format or ADF for Confluence?

```
Are you doing surgical macro / attribute / parameter rewrites?
└── Use storage format (XHTML) — preserves unknown fields byte-for-byte

Are you replacing whole-document content?
└── Use ADF (atlas_doc_format) — modern, future-proof

Are you anchored on text fragments / links?
└── Either works; ADF is more uniform across surfaces

Are you re-rendering from non-Confluence source?
└── Generate ADF directly — don't try to round-trip through storage
```

## Concurrency level?

```
What kind of operations?
├── Bulk reads (POST /bulkfetch)             → concurrency = 1–2
├── Single-entity reads                       → concurrency = 8–10
├── Single-entity writes                      → concurrency = 3–5
├── Writes to the same issue/page (comments, attachments) → concurrency = 1 per entity
└── KVS writes                                → concurrency = 5–10
```

## Audit: sample or full sweep?

```
Pool size?
├── ≤ 500            → full sweep
├── 500 – 10,000     → seeded sample (150 entries, ±5% margin)
├── 10,000 – 100,000 → seeded sample (200 entries)
└── > 100,000        → stratified sample (400 entries) AND a 2nd seed re-run

Is the data high-stakes (security, finance, legal)?
└── full sweep, regardless of pool size

Did the first sample show > 2 FAILs?
└── escalate to full sweep before any release
```

## Identity: email lookup, displayName, or override?

```
Do you have an email for the source user?
├── Yes → email lookup first; if it succeeds, use the result
│         if it returns empty (privacy-restricted), fall through to displayName
│
Do you have a displayName?
├── Yes → exact (case-insensitive) match
│         single hit → use it
│         multiple hits → multiMatch=true; require operator triage
│         zero hits → miss; record in failed CSV
│
No identifier?
└── Skip with reason "no source identity"
```

## Bulk Forge data fix — in-app or remote?

```
Is the data fix tied to user activity in the app?
├── Yes → in-app: trigger by scheduled job or on-demand UI action
│
Is the data fix part of a one-shot migration?
└── Remote: use appSystemToken + KVS REST (this skill's pattern)
         the migration ends; in-app code stays clean

Is the data structure changing too?
├── Yes → remote: easier to debug from a regular Node script
│         migrate the data, redeploy the app with the new shape
└── No  → either; remote is faster to iterate
```

## Two-gate safety on a non-migration script?

```
Does the script ever mutate?
├── Yes → ship --dry-run + --confirm, no exceptions
└── No  → safe to skip; document in usage that it's read-only
```

## When to abort a plan run vs continue with errors

```
Was the error transient (429, 5xx, network)?
└── Continue — the retry state machine handles these

Was the error a payload bug (400, 422)?
├── In one entry      → mark failed, continue, fix later
└── In every entry    → abort; you have a script bug, not a data bug

Was the error auth-related (401, 403)?
└── Abort — there's no use retrying with the wrong credentials

Was the mapping table missing or wrong (404 on lookups)?
└── Abort — you're about to write garbage; fix mappings/ first
```
