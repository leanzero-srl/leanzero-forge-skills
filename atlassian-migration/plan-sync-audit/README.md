# Atlassian Migration — Plan/Sync/Audit track (formerly atlassian-migration-scripts-skill)

Zero-dependency Node.js scaffolding for Atlassian Cloud migration scripts — Data Center → Cloud or Cloud → Cloud.

See [`../SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md) for the full skill content (the file an AI assistant loads when the `atlassian-migration` skill is selected; this track is its first half, Cloud-to-Cloud copy is `../cloud-to-cloud/`).

## What this skill gives you

A `templates/` folder of production-tested code (HTTP clients, plan manager, worker pool, identity resolver, CSV writer, three script templates) and a `docs/` folder of decision-making references (the Plan→Sync→Audit mental model, rate-limit math, the post-JCMA ID-mapping rules, Forge KVS remote mending, gotchas).

Drop the clients into a new folder, fill the TODOs in the three script templates, and you have a resumable, idempotent migration job with CSV outputs for human review and an audit script to verify the outcome.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Scaffold a new migration sub-project
./scripts/new-script.sh ~/my-migration-jobs/fix-broken-filters

# 2. Fill in credentials
cd ~/my-migration-jobs/fix-broken-filters
cp templates/env-example.txt .env && $EDITOR .env

# 3. Sanity check
./scripts/preflight-check.sh
./scripts/test-auth.sh

# 4. Build a plan (no mutations)
node main/plan-script.js --space DOCS --limit 50

# 5. Lint the plan
./scripts/lint-plan-file.sh logs/plan_*.json

# 6. Dry-run the sync (still no mutations)
node main/sync-script.js --execute-only --plan-file logs/plan_*.json --dry-run

# 7. Execute (requires --confirm)
node main/sync-script.js --execute-only --plan-file logs/plan_*.json --confirm

# 8. Audit the result
node main/audit-script.js --plan-file logs/plan_*.json --seed 42 --sample 150

# 9. Roll-up across audit CSVs
./scripts/audit-summary.sh logs/
```

## Why a skill, not a npm package?

Migration scripts are short-lived, one-off jobs. The patterns below are stable; the scripts that use them are not. A skill is the right granularity: load it when you start a migration, copy the bits you need, throw the script away when the migration is done.
