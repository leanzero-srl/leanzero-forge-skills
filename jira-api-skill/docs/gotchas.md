# Forge Development Gotchas (Jira)

This document contains environment-specific facts and common pitfalls that defy reasonable assumptions. Use this to avoid common mistakes during development.

## 🛠️ Development Environment

### Forge Tunnel & Manifest Changes
When you modify `manifest.yml` (e.g., adding a new scope or module), **the running `forge tunnel` will not automatically pick up the changes.**
- **Fix**: Stop the tunnel (`Ctrl+C`) and restart it to apply the new manifest configuration.

### Authentication Context
The behavior of your app changes significantly depending on the authentication method used:
- `api.asApp()`: Executes with the app's own permissions. Best for background tasks and system-level operations.
- `api.asUser()`: Executes with the permissions of the user who triggered the event. Best for UI interactions where user context is required.
- **Gotcha**: If you use `asApp()` for a UI interaction, the user might see data they shouldn't, or the app might perform actions on their behalf that they didn't intend.

## 🌐 Network & Security

### CSP (Content Security Policy) in Custom UI
Custom UI apps run in a highly restrictive sandbox.
- **Issue**: "Refused to load script" or "Refused to connect to..." errors.
- **Fix**: Ensure all external domains are explicitly declared in the `permissions.external.fetch.client` section of your `manifest.yml`.
- **Note**: You cannot use inline `<script>` tags or inline styles in Custom UI.

### Rate Limiting (429)
Jira Cloud has strict rate limits on REST API calls.
- **Issue**: Your app suddenly starts receiving `429 Too Many Requests` errors.
- **Fix**: Implement exponential backoff in your resolver functions. Avoid making massive batches of requests in a single loop.

## 🧩 Module Specifics

### Workflow Validator Errors
When a `jira:workflowValidator` fails, the error message returned via `errorMessage` is what the user sees in the Jira UI.
- **Gotcha**: Keep error messages concise and actionable. Avoid technical jargon or stack traces.

### Custom UI Modal Sizing
The `viewportSize` property for `contentAction` (e.g., `small`, `medium`, `large`) is a hint, not a strict rule.
- **Gotcha**: Extremely complex UIs might feel cramped in `small` or `medium` viewports. Test your UI layout across different sizes.

## Writing Fields (REST)

### Field writes can silently no-op (editmeta before write)
A `PUT /rest/api/3/issue/{key}` to a field that isn't on that issue's **edit screen** (for its project + issue type) returns **2xx but never applies the value** — no error, no warning.
- **Fix**: Pre-flight with `GET /rest/api/3/issue/{key}/editmeta` and only write fields present in `data.fields`. Run it per project/issue-type combo, not per issue, for homogeneous batches. See `06-api-endpoints.md`.
- **Escape hatch**: `PUT ...?overrideScreenSecurity=true` writes off-screen fields anyway, but needs admin permission (non-admin → 403) and bypasses the protection editmeta reports on — use deliberately, not as a default.

### Verify after write — re-read to confirm Jira accepted it
Because writes can be silently dropped (off-screen fields, automation rules, validators, or workflow conditions rewriting your value), a 2xx is **not** proof the change landed. se-ppm-forge re-fetches written issues with `POST /rest/api/3/issue/bulkfetch` and compares each field's actual value against what it intended to write; a mismatch is reported as a real failure.
- **Fix**: For anything you must guarantee (bulk migrations, scheduling writes), re-read the issues after writing and diff expected vs actual. Normalize before comparing (dates, durations) so formatting differences don't read as false mismatches.

### Suppress notification spam on bulk writes (notifyUsers=false)
By default every `PUT /rest/api/3/issue/{key}` e-mails watchers and the assignee.
- **Gotcha**: A loop over hundreds of issues sends hundreds of e-mails and can itself trip rate limits / mail throttling.
- **Fix**: Append `?notifyUsers=false` to bulk/automation writes. Keep notifications on only for genuinely user-initiated single edits.

### Issue-link direction is counter-intuitive
`POST /rest/api/3/issueLink` reads as `inwardIssue <type.outward> outwardIssue` (verified live; matches `25-production-patterns-ppm.md`). For **Blocks**, `inwardIssue` is the blocker/predecessor and `outwardIssue` the blocked/successor — the field names feel reversed vs the UI wording, and admins rename link descriptions per site.
- **Fix**: Before any bulk link creation, GET `/rest/api/3/issueLinkType` to read the inward/outward labels, create one probe link, and re-read the issue (`?fields=issuelinks`) to confirm direction. Details + worked example in `06-api-endpoints.md`.

## `POST /rest/api/3/issue/bulk` returns ONLY the successes

The obvious mapping — `body.issues[n]` is the nth thing you sent — is wrong the
instant one element fails. Jira omits the rejected element from `issues`
entirely and reports it separately in `body.errors[]` by `failedElementNumber`,
so **every later success shifts down by one** and is recorded against the wrong
input.

It also answers **201 for a full success and 400 for a PARTIAL one**, with the
successes still present in `issues` — so the status code alone must not decide
whether anything was created.

On a flat batch that is a mislabel you might never notice. On a **hierarchy** it
is not: if a later pass resolves a child's parent through that same array, one
rejected element silently re-parents everything after it, and you get a tree
that looks plausible and is wrong.

```js
// Read the FAILURES first, then consume the successes against what is left.
const errs = Array.isArray(body?.errors) ? body.errors : [];
const failed = new Set(errs.map((e) => Number(e?.failedElementNumber)).filter(Number.isInteger));
const made = Array.isArray(body?.issues) ? body.issues : [];
const survived = sent.map((s, pos) => ({ s, pos })).filter(({ pos }) => !failed.has(pos));

if (made.length === survived.length) {
  made.forEach((m, n) => record(survived[n].s, m.key));
} else {
  // The counts disagree: Jira told you something you do not understand. Record
  // NOTHING and report every entry as an honest failure — guessing here is
  // exactly how the mis-attribution comes back.
}
```

Carry the caller's original index back with each created issue. Summaries are
neither unique nor echoed verbatim, so once the result array has been compacted
an index is the only reliable way home.

Related: **JQL is eventually consistent**, so do not verify a bulk create by
searching for it. `parent = KEY` can return zero seconds after the children
exist while `GET /issue/{key}` shows the parent set correctly. Read back by key.
